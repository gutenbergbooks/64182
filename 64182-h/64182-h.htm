iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Author of this volume has for
several years past been induced from a partiality to
topographical research, to devote those hours which he could
spare from his professional avocations to an enquiry into the
early history of the town and neighbourhood of Horncastle.&nbsp;
The following pages are the result of his labors, and he would
have been glad to have laid them before the public in a more
perfect form; but from the difficulties which he has had to
encounter with in pursuing an untrodden path, he has been enabled
only to give them as &ldquo;Sketches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the intention of the Author to have published this work
five years ago; but in this he was prevented by local
circumstances, and has subsequently been so by an unfavorable
state of health.&nbsp; He now submits it to the public as the
contribution of his mite towards the long neglected topography of
the county of Lincoln.</p>
<p>The Account of Tattershall having in a separate publication
passed through two editions, the original intention of <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>the Author
was not to have included it in this volume; many of his
Subscribers, however, expressing a wish to the contrary, it is in
compliance therewith now subjoined.</p>
<p>The Author has to return his acknowledgements to those
gentlemen who have so kindly favored him with
communications.&nbsp; From Edmund Turnor, Esquire, of Stoke
Rochford, he received several useful notices; and to his friend
Mr. Richard Hill, lately of Islington, he is not only indebted
for many important communications, but for great assistance in
the arrangement of the work.&nbsp; The principal part of the
chapter on Geology is extracted from &ldquo;A Sketch of the
Geology of the Lincolnshire Wolds, by Mr. Edward Bogg,&rdquo;
published in the third volume of the &ldquo;Transactions of the
Geological Society,&rdquo; and the Author has to acknowledge the
readiness with which Mr. Bogg permitted him to make use of this
valuable paper.&nbsp; The list of plants was furnished by Mr.
John Ward, of Horncastle, and the modern plan of the town by Mr.
C. C. Cremer, of the same place; and to the accurate pencil of
Mr. Thomas Espin of Louth, the Author is indebted for several of
the views with which this volume is illustrated.&nbsp; Without
this assistance he would not have been able to have combined in
his work the information which it at present contains.</p>
<p>April, 1820.</p>

1</span>HORNCASTLE.</h2>
<h3>SITUATION, &amp;c.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Horncastle</span> is pleasantly situated
at the foot of that bold and even range of hills which, from
their openness, have been termed the wolds.&nbsp; It is nearly in
the centre of the Lindsey division of the county of Lincoln, and
is the chief of a soke of fifteen parishes, to which it gives
name.</p>
<p>The principal part of the town is built in an angle formed by
the confluence of two rivers, the Bane and the Waring, where an
ancient fortification formerly stood, the scite of which is still
visible, denoting it to have been a station of importance in
early times.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The
character of the place is however now completely changed.&nbsp;
From a military station it has become a situation of trade; and
being surrounded by a considerable number of villages, possesses
one of the largest markets in the county.</p>
<p>Its distance from the city of Lincoln is twenty-one miles, and
eighteen from the town of Boston.</p>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>HORNCASTLE DURING THE ROMAN AND SAXON GOVERNMENTS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the invasion of Britain by
the Romans, whilst yet the island was divided into independent
states, the present scite of Horncastle with its immediate
neighbourhood was doubtless appropriated, like the rest of the
country of the Coritani, to the pasturing of herds and
flocks.&nbsp; In the formation of settlements no other
circumstances influenced the Britons than the conveniences which
might be afforded them in their accustomed occupations.&nbsp;
Vallies fertilized by streams, and the contiguous hills would
supply food for their cattle and sheep, whilst the neighbourhood
of forests invited to the pursuits of the chase.&nbsp; The rich
tracts of open grass land stretching along the banks of the river
Bane, and its tributary stream, would be populously occupied by
the pastoral inhabitants of this district.&nbsp; Hence it may be
presumed, that when the weak efforts of the Coritani for
independence had left them vanquished by the victorious arms of
the Romans, under Ostorius Scapula, and finally a tributary state
by the more efficient achievements of Suetonius Paulinus, this
portion of the country was soon secured by fixing on the present
scite of Horncastle a military station.&nbsp; From the almost
imperishable masses of the ancient wall which still remain, and
by the numerous coins, urns, and other vestiges of the Roman
people which have been found in this place, and are still met
with in turning up the soil, it apparently became in process of
time a station of considerable importance.&nbsp; It is however
difficult to make any definite suggestions as to the period at
which the fortifications might have been erected, no inscription
having been found throwing light upon the subject.</p>
<p>To secure by effectual barriers against insurrections, the
conquests which had already been made, whilst yet the bordering
people to the north, the fierce and powerful Brigantes, remained
unsubdued, might <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>be deemed a sufficient inducement for raising frequent
and effectual military works among the inhabitants of this state:
for it was not until Petillius Cerealis was appointed by the
emperor Vespasian to the command in the province of Britain, that
that hitherto unbridled nation were either conquered or involved
in all the calamities of warfare.&nbsp; Though there be no
precise data by which the decision may be guided, as to the time
of the earlier military erections which were formed at this
place; yet it cannot be ascribed to a much later period than the
above occurrences so intimately connected.&nbsp; At all events,
it may not be considered posterior to the effects which resulted
from the wise policy of Agricola.&nbsp; Immediately on his
arrival to assume the command, he placed along the frontiers of
the several subjugated districts, a chain of fortresses: these
were constructed with so much care and judgment, that the
inhabitants of those parts where the Roman arms had not then
penetrated, could never consider themselves secure from the vigor
of the conqueror. <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; The people, soon after this,
completed their submission to the yoke by yielding to the
allurements of Roman manners.&nbsp; Their ferocity was tamed:
from a savage people, running wild in woods, they became
cultivated, acquiring knowledge, and dwelling in towns; and
finally sweetened their slavery, by indulging in the pleasures of
polished life.</p>
<p>From the circumstance of this station being situated on the
river Bane, several antiquaries have concurred in fixing here the
<span class="smcap">Banovallum</span> of the Roman geographer
Ravennas.&nbsp; This opinion has been the more readily adopted
from the etymology of the name; the latter part of the word being
Latin, and collectively signifying a fortification on the
Bane.&nbsp; It is indeed probable that the Romans might have been
induced at first to make a station at this place, from its
convenient situation, easily rendered defensible by a
<i>vallum</i>, or temporary barrier, drawn across the aperture of
the two rivers from one bank to the other, and thence came its
designation.&nbsp; Afterwards they built the indissoluble stone
wall, whose vestiges after the lapse of ages are manifest nearly
the whole compass round. <a name="citation4b"></a><a
href="#footnote4b" class="citation">[4b]</a>&nbsp; It is to be
regretted that Ravennas gives <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>no distances: he merely places <span
class="smcap">Banovallum</span> next after <span
class="smcap">Lindum</span>, so that nothing decidedly certain
can be gained from his work.</p>
<p>But, though it cannot be positively ascertained that this spot
was the Roman <span class="smcap">Banovallum</span>; yet as the
name most evidently points out a fortification on the river Bane,
there appears little reason to question it; both from its
contiguity to the colony of <span class="smcap">Lindum</span>,
with which place it had communication by means of a military
road; <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> as also from its situation; particularly
as no other remains of the Romans have been discovered on that
river, nor yet any near to it, except some coins at the village
of Ludford, where the Bane has its source; and traces of an
encampment at Tattershall, more than a mile distant from its
banks.</p>
<p>In what circumstances this station may have been involved from
the final subjugation of the Britons by Agricola, under whose
paternal government the province felt some portion of enjoyment
in cultivating the arts of peace, is not known: but, from the
evidence of antiquities, it is perceptible that it continued a
place of importance down to the period when the Romans in the
decline of their empire had withdrawn from Britain; though
probably, in the security of a long abstraction from war, its
military strength was somewhat disregarded.&nbsp; No sooner
however had the necessities and the mistaken policy of the
enervated inhabitants, again left to themselves, called to their
assistance the warlike Saxons, against the eruptions of the
northern barbarians, than we find this place agitated, in common
with the rest of the country, by all the calamities which were
connected with the desperate contests that ensued;&mdash;the
Britons struggling for liberty, against the eagerness for
dominion on the part of the victorious Saxons.&nbsp; These
people, according to the practice which prevailed amongst them of
changing the names of Roman stations, gave to this the
appellation of <span class="smcap">Hyrncastre</span> or <span
class="smcap">Hornecastre</span>, from its situation in an angle
formed by <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>the junction of the two rivers, which denotes a
fortification in a corner, of which the present name is evidently
a corruption.</p>
<p>The Roman fortress was at that time either destroyed, or in a
very dilapidated state; for Horsa, the Saxon general and brother
of Hengist is stated to have enstrengthened the fortress of
Horncastle.&nbsp; This fortification however did not continue
long; for Horsa being defeated in an engagement with the Britons,
under the command of Raengeires, at the neighbouring village of
Tetford, Vortimer king of the Britons caused it to be beaten down
and rendered defenceless. <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a></p>
<h3><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>THE
MANOR.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the record called Domesday,
compiled towards the latter end of the reign of William the
Conqueror, it appears that the manor of Horncastle, previous to
the close of the Saxon government, belonged to Editha the queen
of Edward the Confessor; but at the time of making that survey it
formed, together with the soke, part of the possessions of the
king. <a name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a></p>
<p>When this manor was separated from the crown does not appear;
but in the reign of Stephen it was the demesne of Alice or
Adelias de Cundi, who resided at her castle here, which leaves it
to be concluded that she held it by inheritance from her father.
<a name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; As she took part against the king
in his contention with the Empress Maud, he seized her lands, but
restored them again on condition that she should demolish her
castle, the means which had served to render her political
alliance formidable to his interest. <a name="citation7c"></a><a
href="#footnote7c" class="citation">[7c]</a>&nbsp; What may have
been the extent and nature of the structure possessed as the
mansion of Adelias is not now discoverable, no traces being to be
found; but its strength most probably consisted in a restoration
of the walls of the Roman fortress, which encircling some
convenient and less durable edifice, gave to the place of her
residence the security of a castle.</p>
<p>The restitution, by Stephen, of these lands to Adelias de
Cundi, seems to have been only for life, as her heir did not
succeed thereto; for this manor came again to the crown, and was
afterwards given by <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Henry the second to Gerbald le Escald, a Fleming, who
held it for one knight&rsquo;s fee. <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; Gerbald le
Escald, was succeeded by his grandson and heir Gerrard de Rhodes;
but for a short time after his death, Ranulph Earl of Chester
appears to have held it, probably in trust for Gerrard de Rhodes,
during his minority.&nbsp; Gerrard was succeeded by his son and
heir Ralph de Rhodes, who in the reign of Henry the third, sold
this manor to Walter Mauclerke, the third Bishop of Carlisle, who
also held the office of Treasurer of the Exchequer.&nbsp; In
conformity with the spirit of the times in which this sale was
effected, the bishop and his successors were to hold the estate
by the performance of suit and service to Ralph de Rhodes and his
heirs.&nbsp; In the fourteenth year of the same reign, the
transfer to Walter Mauclerke was confirmed by the king, who in
the same year also granted to him three several charters,
conferring those immunities upon the manor and soke, which served
to raise the town of Horncastle from the dependence of a village,
to become in some degree the mart of the surrounding country.</p>
<p>The first of these charters gave to the bishop free warren
over this manor and the soke: the second the liberty of holding
an annual fair at this place, which was to commence two days
before the eve of the feast of St. Barnabas, and to continue
eight days: the third had for its objects the empowering of the
bishop to try felons, <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a> and to hold a court
leet; also the exemption of the inhabitants of the manor, and the
soke from toll, and several other payments and services, beside
protecting them from arrest by the sheriff&rsquo;s and
king&rsquo;s officers.&nbsp; An additional charter was granted in
the following year enabling the bishop to hold a weekly market
here every Wednesday; and also another annual fair to commence on
the eve of the feast of St. Lawrence, and to continue seven days.
<a name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a>&nbsp; The custom of holding a fair on
the anniversary of this festival appears to have prevailed at an
earlier period, it being alluded to in the grant of the former
fair.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>In the
same reign, Gerrard, the son and heir of Ralph de Rhodes, appears
to have preferred his claim to this manor, which had been sold by
his father; <a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a> perhaps in consequence of some omission
in the performance of those services by which the estate was to
be held.&nbsp; His claim does not appear to have been successful;
for in the seventeenth year of the same king, the bishop fined to
hold this manor in fee, but not to alienate without licence. <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a></p>
<p>Walter Mauclerke resigned the see of Carlisle in 1246, and as
this manor devolved to his ecclesiastical successors, it may be
inferred that it had been purchased to increase the revenues of
the bishoprick, and not to be appropriated as his private
property.&nbsp; The privileges of such essential interest to the
estate, which had already been conferred by the preceding
charters, were in part strengthened by fresh acknowledgements to
the Bishops of Carlisle, in the reigns of the two succeeding
kings; Edward the first confirming the grant of free warren, <a
name="citation9c"></a><a href="#footnote9c"
class="citation">[9c]</a> and Edward the second that which
exempts the inhabitants of the manor and soke from certain
payments and services. <a name="citation9d"></a><a
href="#footnote9d" class="citation">[9d]</a></p>
<p>At the period of Richard the second, Roger le Scrop and
Margaret his wife, with Robert Tibetot and Eve his wife, heirs
and descendants of Gerbald le Escald, appear to have advanced a
claim to this manor, and to have succeeded in obtaining letters
patent, confirming to them homage and service from the
ecclesiastical possessor. <a name="citation9e"></a><a
href="#footnote9e" class="citation">[9e]</a>&nbsp; At that time
also, when the border contests had laid waste the see of
Carlisle, and divested the bishops of their seat of Rose Castle
in Cumberland, they were necessitated to take up their residence
at Horncastle, which continued for some time to be their
principal place of abode. <a name="citation9f"></a><a
href="#footnote9f" class="citation">[9f]</a></p>
<p>In the twenty-fifth year of Henry the sixth, that monarch
confirmed the several charters granted to the bishops as lords of
this manor, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>by Henry the third, and also conferred on them numerous
other privileges. <a name="citation10a"></a><a
href="#footnote10a" class="citation">[10a]</a></p>
<p>This manor continued in the possession of the Bishops of
Carlisle, until the reign of Edward the sixth, when, under the
authority of a licence from the crown, it was sold by Bishop
Aldrich to Edward Lord Clinton, who, during the time he held it,
compounded with the copyhold tenants, and enfranchised their
estates; but after Mary had ascended the throne, he was compelled
to re-convey his purchase to the see of Carlisle, <a
name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> to which, since that time, it has
continued to belong.&nbsp; Bishop Aldrich died at this place in
March, 1555, the second year of the reign of Queen Mary: from
which it appears, that the estate had either been restored
previous to his decease; or, in the conditions of the sale, he
had reserved to himself the privilege of residing in the manor
house. <a name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c"
class="citation">[10c]</a></p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth had a lease of this manor from the then
possessing bishop, in which she was succeeded by James the first,
who assigned it to Sir Henry Clinton, knight; but owing to a
neglect of enrolment, it proved void. <a
name="citation10d"></a><a href="#footnote10d"
class="citation">[10d]</a>&nbsp; The present lessee is The Right
Honorable Sir Joseph Banks, Baronet, by whom, and his ancestors,
it has been held about a century.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>The
large tract of fen land, situated between this place and Boston,
at a very early period belonged to the lords of this manor, in
conjunction with the lords of the manors of Bolingbroke and
Scrivelsby; but by the grants which they gave to the neighbouring
abbies at Revesby and Kirkstead, their right therein became
comparatively small. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; On the
enclosure of these fens, pursuant to Act of Parliament, in 1801,
about six hundred acres were annexed to the parish of Horncastle,
eighty-one acres of which were allotted to the lord of the manor;
the remainder to the owners of common-right houses.</p>
<p>The parochial extent of Horncastle, exclusive of the fen
allotment, is about one thousand three hundred acres, two hundred
and fifty of which are contained in the manorial estates.</p>

12</span>HORNCASTLE DURING THE CIVIL WARS IN THE REIGN OF CHARLES
THE FIRST.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> that in this part
was born that individual of the family of Plantagenet, whose
assumption of the throne plunged the country, for half a century,
into the civil wars which nearly exterminated the ancient
nobility; yet had the soil here been unstained by the blood so
profusely shed.&nbsp; Partaking, in common with all, the miseries
of the land, it seemed peculiarly exempted from beholding those
contentions of the houses of York and Lancaster which sprung from
the elevation of Henry of Bolingbroke to the sovereignty of
England.&nbsp; It was however otherwise when the usurpation of
unlimited power on the part of Charles the first had urged a war
between the people and the king.&nbsp; As peculiar circumstances
of policy and interest had brought the military operations into
these parts, it will be necessary in their detail to revert to
the conduct of the parties opposed in the opening of the war.</p>
<p>No sooner had the commons demanded concessions from the royal
prerogative, as the only security against the repeated
encroachments which had been made on the privileges of the
people, than they were impelled, by the insincerity of the
monarch, to protect the interest of the subject by every possible
means.&nbsp; The right of the sword was looked upon as the
exalted claim of the patriot alone; but as either party
considered themselves influenced by the sacred love of their
country, both made gradual advances to an appeal: the one to
protect the liberties of the people; the other, those general
interests which seemed connected with upholding the authority of
the king.&nbsp; As the commons were sensible that the monarch
would seize the first favourable opportunity to reinstate himself
in the former excess of his power, the earliest precautions were
taken in regard to the military establishments of the
country.&nbsp; Amongst these was secured the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>important
fortress of Hull, containing the arms of all the forces which had
been levied against the Scots: with these the parliament also
assumed to themselves the disposal of the militia, a force indeed
collected, but totally untried in the conduct of war.&nbsp; The
king, on erecting his standard, opposed to this, as a resource of
strength, his Commission of Array.&nbsp; The call of the monarch
was obeyed by each county, as the political inclinations of
individuals led them, or in submission to the influence and
example of those men of fortune, with whose interests that of
their tenantry was intimately connected. <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a></p>
<p>The contest carried on in the south and in the west with
vigor, already appeared favorable to the royal cause.&nbsp; In
the north, however, it sustained a decided check, by the strong
hold which the parliament possessed in the garrison of Hull, then
commanded by Lord Fairfax, who, unable to maintain the field
against the Marquis of Newcastle, had there retired, determined
to repel a siege with courage and ability; and to diminish the
strength of his enemy by sudden incursions.</p>
<p>The disposable forces of the parliament, not immediately
required for the defence of Hull, were too inconsiderable to
oppose the march into the south.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, the
affairs of the king were ruined by confining the efforts of a
powerful army to investing this fortress; while the active enemy,
though few in number, acquired by their boldness and intrepidity,
an effective strength in the field.&nbsp; When Oliver Cromwell,
then beginning to signalize himself as the companion in arms of
the young and gallant Sir Thomas Fairfax, had by a signal victory
at Gainsborough, routed the royal troops; the Marquis of
Newcastle, beholding his brother Cavendish dead, amid the noblest
and bravest of his soldiers, seemed as if awakened by the calls
of vengeance to the necessity of more extensive exertions.&nbsp;
He therefore suddenly decided on harassing his opponents, while
weak and inefficient, by dispatching a competent force into the
heart of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Cromwell, though a conqueror, was
obliged to make a precipitate retreat; and as Lincoln was not
defensible, he hastened on the day succeeding his victory to
Boston; intending there, with the <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>young Sir Thomas Fairfax, who was
proceeding with additional horse from Hull, to concentrate their
forces with those of the Earl of Manchester. <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>The division of the royal army, destined for these parts, was
entrusted to the command of Sir John Henderson, an old and
valiant soldier, and to Sir William Widdrington, who was
appointed governor of Lincoln.&nbsp; As these leaders were
anxious to requite themselves for the defeat which had so
recently crowned the conquerors with the applause of heroism,
they determined to draw the enemy to an engagement before their
reinforcements should arrive: ere this however could be effected,
Manchester, upon advice of their intention, after possessing
himself of the strong fortress of Lynn, had advanced with the
disposable part of the army of the associated counties.&nbsp;
Such appeared to be the mutual disposition of affairs in the
north, at the beginning of October 1643, in the first year of the
civil war.</p>
<p>The army of the parliament, about six thousand foot, and
thirty-seven troop of horse being concentrated at Boston, it was
determined that companies should be distributed into such parts
as might secure their early co-operation, whensoever occasion
should require.&nbsp; Bolingbroke, defended by a castle held by
the partizans of the king, called forth into exertion their vigor
and the alacrity of their courage. <a name="citation14b"></a><a
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a>&nbsp; This they
decided upon as the place of military operation; whilst as the
neighbourhood promised the most favorable circumstances for a
field, they would there invite the enemy on to battle.&nbsp;
Accordingly ten companies, commanded by Major Knight, an officer
under Sir Miles Hobart, were disposed of at this place.&nbsp; A
regiment was quartered at Stickford, <a name="citation14c"></a><a
href="#footnote14c" class="citation">[14c]</a> about two miles
distant; and three companies of the Earl of Manchester&rsquo;s
own at the village of Stickney.&nbsp; The cavalry were all
distributed into the country round, for about eight or ten miles
distance.</p>
<p>In the evening after their arrival, the castle of Bolingbroke,
was summoned.&nbsp; The answer in effect was, that &ldquo;the
commander need not expect that the demands of arrogance alone
should win the castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this determined reply
promising a strenuous defence, dispositions <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>were
immediately taken to acquire it by a regular siege.&nbsp; The
church and a neighbouring house were occupied by the assailants,
earth works were thrown up, and the assault commenced, but
without much effect.</p>
<p>During this time, the royalists, bold, eager, and trusting
that a generous heroism would nerve them for victory, waited only
the opportunity for attack.&nbsp; Upon learning the arrival of
the Earl of Manchester, they lost no time in drawing out all
their military from the several garrisons of Lincoln, Newark, and
Gainsborough, still stimulated by an undaunted resolution to find
out the enemy and advance to the combat.&nbsp; Hastening on, they
arrived, early on the day previous to the battle, at the
out-posts of the parliamentary forces.</p>
<p>No sooner had a detachment from the king&rsquo;s army,
advancing on the western road, been observed at Edlington,
reconnoitring the lines of their enemy, than word came to Sir
Thomas Fairfax, the commandant of the cavalry at Horncastle, that
a surprize was expected.&nbsp; Information was accordingly
dispatched to the Earl of Manchester: it found him at East Kirkby
hill, with Colonel Cromwell, and the Lord Willoughby of Parham,
intently observing the progress which the besiegers made against
the castle of Bolingbroke, and assiduously ordering the
dispositions of attack.&nbsp; Roused at this communication,
Cromwell immediately hurried to collect the troops dispersed
around.&nbsp; Fairfax was still every where distributing horsemen
for the purpose of enquiry, cautious to ascertain and forward
such accounts as might be obtained of the progress and number of
the royal forces; who though eager for battle, were careful to
deliberate on the promises of success.&nbsp; As the party who
caused the alarm, suspecting themselves seen, had drawn off with
such intelligence as they gathered, there seemed reason to
suppose that the main body of the royalists were yet at a
considerable distance: Fairfax therefore about sun set, learning
nothing additional, proceeded to the quarters at East Kirkby, to
confer on the measures proposed for the expected conflict.&nbsp;
In the mean time the Earl of Manchester, with Lord Willoughby and
some other officers, had with the like object hastened to
Horncastle, previously appointing that at that place the forces
should be immediately collected; where being drawn together, the
most effective resolutions <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>might be taken for ensuring a
victory, or lessening the calamities of a defeat.</p>
<p>It was not until the dusk of the evening that the royal army,
under Sir John Henderson, moved rapidly on to the station of
their enemy.&nbsp; They had judged that the dubious light would
serve to conceal their true numbers; and that as nothing was
known of them with certainty, but their anxious readiness for the
encounter; so their opponents, whether few or many, deeming them
prepared for every casualty, might by their indecision leave an
easy conquest to their arms.</p>
<p>The out-posts were surprized by the precipitate advance of
these hostile forces; and in the unprepared circumstances of
those who maintained them, and the disparity of their numbers,
there was afforded them no means of encountering their
difficulties, but the hardihood of a cool intrepidity.&nbsp; This
indeed was a stern calmness which always pervaded the breast of a
Puritan who was a soldier.&nbsp; He did not untremblingly bare
his bosom to the steel because, like a Roman, he abstractedly
considered fear inconsistent with the nobler qualities of human
nature; but because the factitious enthusiasm of his religion had
taught him to look with indifference on temporal things.&nbsp; If
the general good required the sacrifice of his life, the
particular calamities of his family were dismissed with scarce a
thought beyond a pious supplication.&nbsp; It was this feeling
which finally rendered the parliament victorious in their
contest.&nbsp; However in this unlooked-for state the soldiers at
the out-posts were exposed to much perplexity, and many were the
dangers recited amongst them on the morning of the gathering of
their strength for the field of battle.&nbsp; Some finding
themselves surrounded, out-numbered, and in all the perilous
circumstances of desperate warfare, were obliged to supply by
politic conduct the helplessness of their condition.&nbsp; These
therefore, hastily mounting their horses, agreed with much
resolution to break through the opposing ranks, sword in hand,
with the words of mutual encouragement, &ldquo;Come on! come on!
all is our own,&rdquo; thinking that the enemy, by these
ambiguous shouts, fearing an ambuscade, would leave to them an
easy passage by the sudden confusion of their alarm.&nbsp; In
this manner about four companies encountered two thousand
cavalry, with the loss of only three men.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Though
these warriors, taking the advantage of the darkness of the
evening, were enabled by their resolute conduct to overcome these
difficulties; yet as the royal army had already advanced onward
to Horncastle, in strong and numerous detachments, they were
exposed in their retreat thither to fresh and obstinate
encounters.&nbsp; Perceiving, as they approached the town, that
they had come up to another party of the enemy&rsquo;s horse,
they determined, after saluting them as friends, to hurry onward
as if destined for some urgent duty.&nbsp; They had, however,
scarce passed them, when flushed with the success of their
stratagem, and feeling the pride and bravado of soldiers, who
deemed their individual preservation as of little value to their
common strength, if purchased without the blood of their enemy,
they turned to the attack of the unwary royalists.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For whom are ye?&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the
king.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are for the king and
parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scarcely had these declarations been
interchanged, when rushing precipitately on the unsuspecting
enemy, and throwing them into disorder, they fled towards the
town, deeming themselves secure in the quarters of their
comrades, and considering their valour rewarded in the
acclamations that would greet them from their friends.&nbsp; But
Horncastle, surprized at the approach of numerous hostile forces,
had been evacuated by the detachment of horse which possessed it;
and the inhabitants, as soon as the town was seized by the troops
of the king, having secured the entrances and roads through it,
by forming barriers with carts and timber; the cavalry found
themselves again obliged to exert their unyielding valor in
turning upon their pursuers.&nbsp; Desperately therefore they
burst through them with the full energy of their courage,
sustaining the loss of some few men, among whom was a cornet; but
bringing away prisoners as the evidence of their perils and their
triumph. <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>At this period of hurried confusion, and the setting in of the
night, the Earl of Manchester reached the town.&nbsp; He heard
the rejoicings of the troops, thus victorious in the dangers of
their retreat; taunting the enemy with their shouts, as they drew
off undefeated from their toils.&nbsp; Finding now that the place
designed for the assembling of his forces was already possessed
by the enemy, he hastily recalled the <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>orders for the general rendezvous at
Horncastle, and appointed Bolingbroke in its stead.&nbsp; Thither
at night repaired the dispersed soldiery of the parliament,
except three or four troops of horse, who in the difficulties of
retreating before superior forces, had been obliged to proceed by
the circuit of Tattershall, and did not arrive until the next
morning.</p>
<p>At Bolingbroke, Manchester designed to wait for the enemy; but
Cromwell, actuated by prudence, urged the delaying of the battle,
since the troops, upon whose prowess and exertion success
depended, were wearied, and little able to sustain the ardour of
the fight. <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; The royal army were however too
eager to secure the promises of a victory, to permit their
adversaries to renew their strength by avoiding the
contest.&nbsp; As soon as the morning had dawned and the silence
of the surrounding country assured them that their enemies were
withdrawn from near them, and were assembling together at
Bolingbroke, they arrayed themselves for the encounter.&nbsp;
Before the middle of the day they marched out, in strength about
seventy-five troops of horse, and five thousand foot, to meet the
soldiers of the parliament.&nbsp; Foreboding with certainty that
this would be their determination, Manchester was constrained to
the resolution of giving them battle, and immediately advanced
towards them.</p>
<p>The spot upon which the contending armies engaged was a gently
rising and broadly extended eminence, at a village called
Winceby, midway between Horncastle and Bolingbroke.&nbsp; It
commands an extensive prospect of the far stretched fen-lands of
the county; whilst to the westward is seen those cliffs, on the
summit of one of which magnificently rises the cathedral of
Lincoln.&nbsp; This the royal army had contemplated as a
district, which by victory was either to be restored to the
authority of the king; or by defeat to afford an effectual check
to the military operations in the north, and to be ensured as a
further resource to the parliament.&nbsp; The noon was already
passed when the armies came in sight of each other.&nbsp; The
royalists trusting with confidence to their mutual ardor,
rejoiced when they beheld the adverse soldiers advancing to meet
them, though amid the wild chant of hymns <a

for victory.&nbsp; In the fields immediately before them they
fixed the order of their battle: formed into closely compacted
lines, the cavalry was placed in the advance, and covered the
infantry.&nbsp; The left wing of this array, was commanded by the
general Sir John Henderson. <a name="citation19a"></a><a
href="#footnote19a" class="citation">[19a]</a></p>
<p>The Earl of Manchester, pressed for ground in the marshalling
of his forces, presented alone his cavalry to the fight; the
infantry, headed by himself, being stationed so far in the rear
that they were unable to second the exertions of their horsemen.
<a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a>&nbsp; The disadvantages arising from
fatigue, with the closeness of ground, and inequality of numbers
were apparent to the warriors of the parliament.&nbsp; In the
doubtful promises of the contest, their leaders sought to
replenish their strength, and supply their situation by words and
by actions, infusing into them an energy and martial ardour
rivalling their own.&nbsp; Fairfax, who knew by experience that
the undaunted intrepidity of a few was more efficient in its
achievements than the impetuosity of those who relied for
security on their numbers, pointed to his men the imposing array
of his adversaries, exclaiming &ldquo;Come let us fall on; I
never prospered better than when I fought with my enemies three
or four to one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cromwell, by the apparent bravery
with which he was animated, promised them that examples of
heroism should not be wanted, whilst life was given him to lead
them. <a name="citation19c"></a><a href="#footnote19c"
class="citation">[19c]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the commander of the royal forces did not
lose the opportunity which was afforded him of reminding his
fellow soldiers that vengeance was yet due for the defeat at
Gainsborough; and that now was supplied them a time to requite
themselves for the blood of the illustrious brother of
Newcastle.&nbsp; He set before them the necessity of strenuous
exertions and important sacrifices, by pointing to the example of
one, who exalted amidst the mighty of the land, lately fighting
among them, did not hesitate to devote himself to death for the
cause of his sovereign.&nbsp; At the moment therefore when the
armies were ready to engage, the royalists raised the cry of
&ldquo;Cavendish! on for <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Cavendish!&rdquo; which was as loudly
answered by the enthusiastic shout of &ldquo;Religion!&rdquo; the
zeal which animated those who proclaimed it, by inspiring them
with hopes of immortality, rendered death less to be dreaded than
the misfortunes of a defeat. <a name="citation20a"></a><a
href="#footnote20a" class="citation">[20a]</a></p>
<p>Scarce had the words of onset been given, when the divisions
of cavalry, under the command of Cromwell and Fairfax, were led
to the charge by Vermeydun, a soldier of valour, who headed the
first detachment as a forlorn hope, aspiring to the honour of
directing his comrades on to victory.&nbsp; Already the horsemen
of the royalists, with a well directed precision, had vigorously
poured into their ranks the second discharge of their fire
arms.&nbsp; These did some execution among them; and Cromwell
thus early had his horse shot under him.&nbsp; A minute had
elapsed before the parties fiercely met in the close encounter,
arm to arm.&nbsp; Cromwell for a time was compelled to grapple on
foot with his enemies, entangled amid the trappings of his dying
charger.&nbsp; Though felled to the ground as he attempted to
extricate himself from this perilous situation, he rose
uninjured.&nbsp; This singular man, bold and intrepid, animated
by zeal, foremost in the fight, struggling with disasters, seemed
peculiarly preserved in all his dangers, to fill that situation
in the page of history, where, though elevated by violence, he
powerfully commands our admiration by his success, his prudence,
and the daring of his genius.&nbsp; Sir Ingram Hopton, who at
this moment had attempted to seize him, was killed. <a
name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a>&nbsp; Cromwell, now recovering a horse
from a soldier near him, bravely led on his companions to the
combat, strengthening their stern courage by the most signal
proofs of his personal bravery.</p>
<p>Not with less valor was the conflict sustained on the part of
the royalists.&nbsp; Sir John Henderson, the hardy veteran of
former battles, firm as a rock amid the rushing of the waves,
resisted every impetuous assault.&nbsp; His adversaries were
driven back in disorder; but these men, not readily to be
repulsed, returned, with a cool bravery and redoubled <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>vigor to the
attack.&nbsp; For half an hour, firm and undecided, continued the
contest, sword against sword, and fortitude repelling
courage.&nbsp; The resolute warriors, who sustained the furious
charges of Fairfax and Cromwell, (for the whole were not
engaged,) relinquished not a portion of their ground.&nbsp; At
last, a division commanded by Sir William Saville wavering,
though reluctant to give way, became routed and completely
disordered.&nbsp; Yielding they struck confusion into the other
bodies of their own horse; and these again were hurled with
precipitance upon the mass of their infantry.&nbsp; All being
alike borne down in this part of the field, none were left to
second the broken and disordered in again advancing to the
combat.&nbsp; The division of Sir John Henderson and Lord Ething
alone maintained itself unyielding and unsubdued.&nbsp; The
exulting army of the parliament, now taking advantage of the
discomfiture of the other troops, and the tumult of the infantry,
assailed with a desperate charge the yet unrepulsed.&nbsp; In
vain did the royalist commander exhort his men to be resolute and
undismayed; but no prudence could uphold the advantages which
valor must lose.&nbsp; Their fortitude was giving way to despair;
and the successful, elated with the promises of victory, found no
equal disputants in men dismayed by the certainty of a
defeat.&nbsp; Perplexed amid the various and ineffectual efforts
of the other bodies of the royal troops, the disheartened
defenders of the field yielded beneath the shock of the adverse
weapons.&nbsp; The victorious soldiers now fiercely plunging in
amidst the routed dragoons, many of whom at this time were on
foot and in the most appalling confusion, saw them quickly
disappearing beneath the havoc of their swords and the fury of
their horses.&nbsp; The infantry were for the most part
destroyed; for being intercepted by a body of cavalry, scarce a
man survived the carnage. <a name="citation21a"></a><a
href="#footnote21a" class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; There was
now no safety but in a dishonorable flight.&nbsp; The pursuit
continued beyond Horncastle with unremitting fury; and along the
road were strewed the horse and the rider, the dead and the
dying. <a name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>The
soldiers under the command of Manchester, who as yet had partaken
in no respect in the glory of the blood-shed, reserved their
efforts for securing the prisoners, and assisting the scarce
breathing wounded of the enemy, who were scattered about the
field in groups.&nbsp; Such partisans as had recently been
embodied by the commission of array were pitiably supplicating
the mercy of their conquerors.&nbsp; Cursing with deep execration
that little regard which had hurried them to the fight, without a
feeling of interest in its issue, they cried out that the
commission of array had brought them thither against their wills,
and blessing the cause of liberty and religion, added &ldquo;We
die as true servants of the parliament as any in England, and woe
be to those who were the cause that Lincoln and York became the
prey of such a war.&rdquo; <a name="citation22a"></a><a
href="#footnote22a" class="citation">[22a]</a></p>
<p>Though the battle was fought with determined obstinacy; yet,
whilst the parties maintained their ground, the loss was
comparatively small: the havoc that ensued was among the routed
and the flying.&nbsp; There were killed but few on the side of
the parliament.&nbsp; Those of rank who were slain of the royal
forces were Sir George Bolles, and Sir Ingram Hopton.&nbsp; The
prisoners, about one thousand in number, were the wounded on the
field, and those parties of the dispersed fugitives, who to avoid
the overwhelming carnage of their pursuers had secreted
themselves amongst the rugged and winding banks of a neighbouring
river: many indeed were taken whilst seeking refuge in the very
waters, where some had already perished, bleeding and wearied in
their armour, overcome in their inability to recover themselves
from the deeper parts of the stream.&nbsp; The trophies which the
conquerors obtained in the fight of Winceby field, were arms for
fifteen hundred men, and thirty-five standards. <a
name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a></p>
<p>Returning from the pursuit, the exhausted cavalry rested for
the night in the villages around Horncastle.&nbsp; The infantry
occupied quarters in the town, where they found two hundred
horses left by their fugitive enemy.&nbsp; Of the wounded, the
Earl of Manchester ordered especial care to be taken, whilst the
dead were hastily consigned to the nearest graves.&nbsp; The body
of Sir Ingram Hopton was brought to <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Horncastle and buried in the church:
for Cromwell who did not permit his political resentment to
render him callous or insensible to the generous feelings of a
soldier, experienced some sympathy for the individual whose ardor
in attempting his destruction, for what was deemed the welfare of
his country, had cost the sacrifice of his own life; he
therefore, upon his arrival in the town, commanded the
inhabitants to fetch the body of Sir Ingram Hopton, and inter it
with the honors due to his rank; observing that though an enemy,
he was a gentleman and a soldier. <a name="citation23a"></a><a
href="#footnote23a" class="citation">[23a]</a></p>
<p>Of those royalists who escaped the slaughter, there were
scarce a thousand efficient for the field; and these were
destined to sustain another overthrow at the battle of Lincoln
close, which completed the warfare in this county.&nbsp;
Bolingbroke castle had already yielded; and this with
Tattershall, the principal places of defence in this
neighbourhood, were soon after devoted to the dismantling policy
of the parliament, which doomed them with the noble edifices of
the country, to that destruction which left them but ruins in
silent and lingering decay.</p>
<p>Although this victory afforded a cause for so much rejoicing
to the friends of the parliament; yet were its consequences
mightier for the interests which it strengthened, by the defeat,
on the same day, <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> of the Marquis of Newcastle before the
fortress of Hull.&nbsp; The Lord Fairfax and Sir John Meldrum,
making a desperate sortie, had completely overthrown the
royalists with much slaughter; forcing them, though protected
behind strong entrenchments, to abandon the siege with the loss
of all their cannon.&nbsp; The impolicy of the royalist commander
was now perceptible too late.&nbsp; This ruin of the affairs of
the king seemed at once to have obliterated all the generous
services which the faithful Newcastle had made in the cause of
his sovereign; and shortly after these disasters he retired to
the continent, <a name="citation23c"></a><a href="#footnote23c"
class="citation">[23c]</a> where he spent a life of indigence,
until the restoration gave again the royal authority to
Britain.&nbsp; <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>These actions, though inconsiderable in themselves, were
yet great in their effects.&nbsp; The expectations of the
royalists in Yorkshire were now nearly blasted: Lincolnshire,
after the occupation of its city, escaped the further deluge of
blood; and the defeats served to assist in hastening the fight of
Marston Moor, where the hopes of Charles were reduced to that one
gleam of hope, which was finally extinguished at the battle of
Naseby.</p>

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the remains of antiquity at
this place, the vestiges of the Roman fortress are the most
worthy of attention; and although they are too small to give an
adequate idea of the original structure, are yet sufficient to
show the form and extent of the space enclosed, which appears to
have been nearly a parallelogram, of about six hundred feet in
length, and in breadth three hundred and fifty on the east, and
three hundred on the west. <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; The wall by
which this area was surrounded was fifteen or sixteen feet in
thickness, and composed of small blocks of a loosely aggregated
sand stone, dug from the neighbouring hills.&nbsp; It was formed
with casing stones on the outside, the internal <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>parts being
filled up with courses laid diagonally, which according to the
customary and substantial mode of building among the Romans, were
run together by mortar disseminated through the interstices in a
fluid state, forming a cement which has acquired by time an
imperishable induration.&nbsp; Of the casing stones none are now
to be seen, except in cellars which have been formed by the side
of the wall.&nbsp; Where the fragments are sufficiently high,
those portions of the Roman masonry, which remained after the
destruction of the fortress, may be perceived rising to about six
or seven feet above the ground, the diagonal courses of stone
then ceasing.&nbsp; Above this the construction is marked by
masses of larger dimensions than the lower parts; a circumstance
evincing that another structure of a different period has been
erected on the original foundation: this was probably a
reparation which was made in the time of the Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp;
At the north-east corner of the enclosure the remains of a
circular turret are still visible; but of towers or gateways no
traces are left.</p>
<p>Near the junction of the two rivers, on the south-west of the
town, was formerly one of those mazes common to Roman stations,
called the Julian Bower.&nbsp; In these the youth were exercised
in a martial game, called Troy Town, which in after years, though
divested of its martial character, continued to be amongst the
healthy pastimes of the young, in their evening assemblies of
pleasure and sport. <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; Cultivation
has long since effaced every vestige of the maze; but the piece
of land on which it stood still retains the name of the <i>Julian
Bower Close</i>.</p>
<p>A peculiar rustic ceremony, which used annually to be observed
at this place, doubtless derived its origin from the Floral games
of antiquity.&nbsp; On the morning of May-day, when the young of
the neighbourhood assembled to partake in the amusements which
ushered in the festivals of the month of flowers, a train of
youths collected themselves <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>at a place to this day called the
<i>May Bank</i>.&nbsp; From thence, with wands enwreathed with
cowslips, they walked in procession to the may-pole, situated at
the west end of the town, and adorned on that morning with every
variety in the gifts of Flora.&nbsp; Here, uniting in the wild
joy of young enthusiasm, they struck together their wands, and
scattering around the cowslips, testified their thankfulness for
that bounty, which widely diffusing its riches, enabled them to
return home rejoicing at the promises of the opening year.&nbsp;
That innovation in the manners and customs of the country, which
has swept away the ancient pastimes of rustic simplicity,
obliterated about forty years ago this peculiar vestige of the
Roman Floralia.</p>
<p>In the fields on the south side of the town, the ground
abounds with fragments of cinerary urns, and several perfect ones
have also there been discovered.&nbsp; From these circumstances,
together with the appearance of the soil, it seems certain that
in this part the Romans used to burn their dead on the funeral
pile.&nbsp; Of the urns found, only two are known to exist in the
neighbourhood; one being in the collection of Sir Joseph Banks,
at Revesby Abbey, the other in the possession of Mr. Crowder, an
inhabitant of the town.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted for the advancement of researches
into local antiquities that the chief part of the urns, coins,
fibul&aelig;, and other Roman vestiges discovered at Horncastle,
have been sold to strangers who have visited the town, or to
dealers elsewhere.&nbsp; The coins which have been found here are
numerous, and though chiefly of small brass and denarii
&aelig;rei of the lower empire, yet they include many extremely
fine and varied specimens of the earlier imperial coins, both of
a larger size and of other metals, several of which are in the
possession of different individuals in the town.&nbsp; Amongst
these may be particularized the silver coins of Vespasian, L.
Septimius Severus, Alexander Severus, and Volusianus; the large
brass of Trajan; and the middle brass of Caligula, Claudius,
Nero, Trajan, Hadrian, Domitian, Antoninus Pius, Faustina the
elder, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and Faustina the younger.&nbsp;
The small brass and denarii &aelig;rei form nearly a complete
series of the emperors from Gallienus to Valentinanus the second,
and include also within that period, coins of some of the tyrants
of Britain and Gaul.&nbsp; Beside these are some others in the
collection <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>of the late Reverend Charles L&rsquo;Oste, now possessed
by his son, but unfortunately no memoranda exist by which they
are to be distinguished from those obtained at other
places.&nbsp; This gentleman also had in his collection several
fibul&aelig; and stiles which had been discovered here.</p>
<p>A British coin found at this place has on its concave side the
horse and symbolic circles; on the convex is the representation
of an animal apparently intended for a stag, with similar
ornaments around it, as the other side possesses.&nbsp; Many of
the early English silver currency have been found here, and also
a specimen of the Scottish coinage of David the second.</p>
<p>In deepening the bed of the river Bane, to complete the
navigation, in 1802, an ornamental brass spur, part of a brass
crucifix, and a dagger, were found together at a short distance
from the north bason of the navigation.&nbsp; The spur is now
lost; the part of the crucifix and the dagger are in the
possession of the author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the silence of the Domesday
Book respecting a church at this place, it may be concluded that
there was not one erected when that survey was made; there
however appears to have been one in the reign of Richard the

</a></p>
<p>The present structure, which is dedicated to Saint Mary,
stands in the centre of the town, and possesses but few
attractions for the antiquary or the architect.&nbsp; It consists
of a square tower, a nave and chancel, with north and south
aisles.&nbsp; Being for the most part built with the soft and
imperfectly aggregated sand-stone of the neighbourhood, which
yields easily to the moisture of the atmosphere, it has suffered
much from the effects of time; and the decayed parts being
repaired with brick gives to the building a motley and
unprepossessing appearance.</p>
<p>The few portions of the original architecture which have
escaped the silent ravages of years, and the hands of the
innovator, bespeak the building of no higher antiquity than the
period of Henry the seventh.&nbsp; The aisle on the north side of
the chancel is ornamented with embattlements, on which
quatrefoils and blank shields are sculptured.&nbsp; It was
probably used as a chantry, one of the windows of the aisle
having formerly contained an inscription justifying such a
supposition. <a name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a> This aisle does not extend the whole
length of the chancel, and in the space so left, the remains of
an oratory and confessional are still visible: this space
formerly appropriated as a depository for coals to distribute
among the poor, is now occupied by a building to contain the fire
engines; a corresponding part of the south aisle being used as a
vestry.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>The
interior of the church is remarkably neat and well pewed.&nbsp; A
gallery at the west end of the nave contains an organ which was
purchased by subscription in 1810.&nbsp; Galleries are also
erected in each aisle of the nave.</p>
<p>In the wall of the north aisle is a stone, containing the
figure in brass of Sir Lionel Dymoke, in armour, kneeling on a
cushion, and holding in his hand a label on which is written,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sc&rsquo;ta trinitas unus deus miserere
nob.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On each side of him are two shields containing arms, at one of
the lower corners are the figures of his two sons, and at the
other those of his three daughters, and under him this
inscription:</p>

</a></p>
<h3>THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the south-east corner of the
church yard is the Grammar School, a spacious and well
constructed edifice of brick.&nbsp; It was founded and endowed by
Edward Lord Clinton and Saye, the Lord High Admiral of England,
under the authority of letters patent, dated the 25th of June,
1652. <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; By these letters it was ordained,
that this institution should be denominated &ldquo;The Free
Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth, in the Town or Soke of
Horncastle, of the foundation of Edward Lord Clinton and
Saye,&rdquo; for the education, training, and instruction of boys
and youths in grammar, and to be appropriated to this object for
ever.</p>
<p>The school was to be conducted by a master, and a sub-master,
or usher: ten governors were also appointed and incorporated,
with perpetual succession, and a common seal.&nbsp; These
governors were empowered on the death of any of their body, to
elect others in their places; also to nominate the master and
usher on any vacancy; and to make such statutes concerning the
preservation and disposal of the revenues, as circumstances at
any time might dictate.&nbsp; Besides holding the endowments,
they were authorized to purchase and receive lands and other
possessions, not exceeding &pound;40. per annum.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>The
estates by which the establishment is maintained, consist of
houses and land situated at Horncastle, Hemingby, Sutton, Huttoft
and Winthorpe.&nbsp; The lands in the last three named parishes
being subject to inundations from the sea, the annual revenue is
rendered precarious; but in the more favorable years it amounts
to about &pound;200.</p>
<p>The salaries for a long time were &pound;40. per annum to the
master, and &pound;30. to the sub-master or usher: but on the
appointment of the present master, in 1818, the salary was
advanced to &pound;80. per annum, to which was also added a house
for his residence; the salary of the sub-master remaining as
heretofore, at &pound;30.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;2. 2s. per
annum is charged for those scholars who are instructed in writing
and arithmetic.&nbsp; There are at this period about twenty boys
on the foundation.</p>
<p>The governors of this institution have also the management of
another school in the town, for the instruction of poor children
in reading, sewing, and knitting.&nbsp; A house, with a salary to
the teacher of &pound;30. per annum, charged upon certain estates
in Horncastle, having been bequeathed to them in trust, for that
purpose, by Mr. Richard Watson, a native of this place, who died
in 1784.</p>
<h3><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>THE
RIVER BANE AND NAVIGABLE CANAL.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> river Bane, rising at the
village of Ludford, takes its course in a direction nearly south
to join its waters with those of the Witham.&nbsp; After
meandering through an extent of country about fourteen miles, it
receives at Horncastle, the tributary stream of the Waring, and
abundantly supplies the town, conveniently situated at the
confluence of the two rivers.&nbsp; From hence continuing a
gently winding course, it washes Tattershall and its moorlands,
before it falls into the larger river, to increase its waters to
the sea.</p>
<p>In the year 1792, an act of parliament was obtained for making
the Bane navigable from the river Witham, through Tattershall to
Horncastle. <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a>&nbsp; The act, after reciting the names
of the original subscribers, incorporates them by the name of
&ldquo;The Company of Proprietors of the Horncastle Navigation in
the County of Lincoln,&rdquo; giving them perpetual succession
and a common seal, and empowering them to raise &pound;1500. in
three hundred shares of &pound;50. each.&nbsp; The interest of <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>these was not
to exceed &pound;8. per cent.&nbsp; No person was to be the
possessor of less than one share, nor to hold more than
twenty.&nbsp; As circumstances might require, they were
authorized to raise &pound;1,000. more, by shares or mortgages of
the tolls.</p>
<p>The tollage allowed by this act was, for goods passing the
whole length of the navigation, 2<i>s.</i> per ton; from the
Witham to the seventh lock, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per ton; and
from the Witham to the fourth lock, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per
ton; excepting lime, lime-stone, manure, or materials for roads,
for which, only half the already mentioned tolls were to be
taken.</p>
<p>The works were commenced in the year 1793: but, when about two
thirds were completed, the whole of the funds to be appropriated
to their execution were already expended.&nbsp; After suffering
the canal to remain several years in this unfinished state, the
company applied again to Parliament, and in the year 1800 another
act was obtained, enabling them to raise &pound;20,000. more by
subscription amongst themselves, by admission of new subscribers
in shares of &pound;50. each, by mortgage, or by granting
annuities.&nbsp; The limitation of shares and interest were
repealed by this act; and the tonnage rates advanced to
3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per ton for the whole length of the
navigation, 2<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> to the seventh lock, and
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the fourth; lime, lime-stone, manure,
and materials for roads excepted as before from the payment of
full rates.</p>
<p>Shortly after the works were recommenced, the plan of
completing them by an entirely new canal was adopted in
preference to that which they had before pursued of rendering the
Bane navigable.&nbsp; It was therefore at the village of Dalderby
diverted from the course of the natural stream, and carried on in
a less varied track to the point of junction between the waters
of the Bane and Waring: from hence it was continued in the
divergent courses of these two rivers, to the more extreme parts
of the town of Horncastle.&nbsp; It was completed in September,
1802, and on Friday the seventeenth of that month the vessels
entered the town.&nbsp; The canal is sufficiently deep to
navigate vessels of fifty tons burthen.</p>
<p>From this town to the river Witham the distance is about
eleven miles, in which the stream has a fall of eighty-four
feet.</p>

PRESENT STATE OF THE TOWN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> this place was favored at
an early period with a charter for a market, which in the time of
Henry the eighth appears to have been well frequented, yet it
remained for many years little more than a considerable village.
<a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a>&nbsp; From the earliest accounts it
seems to have been gradually encreasing; but it was not until
later years, when a new impulse was given to the agricultural
interests of the country, that it began to exhibit material
evidences of extension and improvement.</p>

"Plan of Horncastle in 1722, from &ldquo;Stukeley&rsquo;s
Itinerarium&rdquo;"
 src="images/p39s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>From a plan of the town drawn by Dr. Stukeley, in the year
1722, it appears at that period of time, now nearly the lapse of
a century, to have been little more than half its present
extent.&nbsp; This plan, not having been made from actual survey,
cannot be considered as an accurate representation: nevertheless
it is calculated to give a tolerable idea of the state of the
town at the time it was executed.&nbsp; It is traditionally
asserted that at that period scarcely a brick house was to be
found in the parish; the early erected dwellings being all
constructed with clay walls, and covered with thatch; thus
evidencing that common character which Leland the antiquary
assigns to the towns of this part.&nbsp; The clay buildings have
for the most part disappeared, and brick structures are now
erected in their stead; and from the spirit of improvement which
has lately been evinced, they will doubtless in a few years be
entirely removed.&nbsp; The rebuilding of many houses in the
principal streets in a handsome manner, within the last twenty
years, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>has
given to the town an air of respectability; but the effect which
would be produced by these buildings in its general appearance,
is materially diminished, by the narrowness and irregularity of
the streets.&nbsp; At this time the number of houses may be
computed at about seven hundred, and of inhabitants, about three
thousand five hundred.</p>
<p>The entrances to the town, as well as its general aspect, have
also been improved by the inclosure of the fields by which it is
surrounded.&nbsp; To accomplish this an act of parliament was
obtained in 1803, and carried into effect the following year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>In no respect has the town changed more than in its trade; a
large proportion of its inhabitants having formerly been employed
in the tanning of leather, in which manufacture the yards on the
south side of the Far-street were almost exclusively
occupied.&nbsp; About fifty years ago the number of these
establishments began rapidly to decline, and are at this time
reduced to two.&nbsp; Since the completion of the canal in 1801,
a considerable trade in corn and wool has been carried on here;
about thirty thousand quarters of the former, and three thousand
sheets of the latter being annually sent from this place.&nbsp;
The town also from its situation in a well inhabited district
enjoys a large retail trade.</p>
<p>There are now three fairs for horses, cattle and sheep, held
here annually.&nbsp; The first, which concludes on the
twenty-second of June, has of late years declined very much, and
though chartered for eight days seldom continues more than
three.&nbsp; The second, which terminates on the twenty-first of
August, has long been celebrated as the largest fair for horses
in the kingdom, perhaps it may be said in the world; it continues
about ten days, being three days more than the time expressed in
the charter.&nbsp; To this fair are brought for sale horses of
all descriptions from every part of the kingdom, to the number of
many thousands; and beside the most extensive dealers of this
country, there are to be found in the fair purchasers and dealers
from different parts of the continent of Europe, and even from
America.&nbsp; The third fair, which is held on the twenty-eighth
and twenty-ninth days of October, was removed to this place in
1768, from Market-Stainton, a decayed market town, about eight
miles distant, two hundred pounds being given to the lord of the
manor of that place, to permit the <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>removal, one half of this sum was
raised by subscription amongst the inhabitants of this town, the
other by the lessee of the manor. <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; The market is
now held every Saturday, to which it was changed from Wednesday,
the day mentioned in the charter, probably in consequence of the
markets at Boston and Louth being also on that day; but the time
at which the alteration took place cannot now be ascertained.</p>
<p>A building, situated on the south side of the church yard, is
appropriated for the purposes of a Dispensary, which is supported
by public subscription.&nbsp; Those to whom medical aid is
administered, are such of the sick poor as are recommended by
subscribers; and the many to whom assistance has been afforded,
evince its utility in a striking degree.&nbsp; The number of
patients admitted from the commencement of the institution in
September 1789, to September 1818, was 9253.&nbsp; It is attended
two days in the week by two physicians, whose services are
gratuitous, and by an apothecary, who receives a salary.&nbsp; A
female accoucheur has also been lately added to the
establishment.</p>
<p>A Literary Society, which was established here in the year
1790, has formed a permanent library, which is kept at the
Dispensary.&nbsp; It contains about one thousand volumes, and is
open to the members two days in the week.&nbsp; For several years
the subscription was only ten shillings and sixpence per annum;
it was afterwards advanced to fourteen shillings, and
subsequently to one pound.&nbsp; Subscribers are now also
required to pay ten shillings and sixpence on their
admission.&nbsp; The society at present consists of about forty
members.</p>
<p>In the year 1807 the inhabitants of this town in conjunction
with several other towns and villages, in the county of Lincoln,
made application to parliament, and obtained an act for the
recovery of debts not exceeding the sum of five pounds.&nbsp; The
commissioners hold their courts at this place, as well as at the
other towns specified in the act, every fourth Thursday.</p>
<p>The education of the poor which has lately excited so much
attention in various parts of the kingdom, has not been neglected
here.&nbsp; A school on the Lancasterian or British system was
established at a public meeting held in October, 1813; and but a
few days subsequently <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>a meeting was held at the church,
when it was resolved to establish also a school on the plan of
Dr. Bell.&nbsp; Early in the ensuing year buildings were erected,
and each system began to be acted upon.&nbsp; Both schools are
supported by voluntary contributions, and each contains about two
hundred children.</p>
<p>Beside the established church, there are in this town a
society of Wesleyan Methodists, a small congregation of
Calvinistic Baptists, and a newly formed society of primitive
Methodists.</p>
<h2><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>THE
SOKE OF HORNCASTLE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of compiling the
Domesday record, there appears to have been included other
parishes, in addition to those now comprised in this soke; but it
cannot now be ascertained at what time the alteration took
place.&nbsp; Beside the parish of Horncastle it at present
contains the following townships:&mdash;Thimbleby, West Ashby,
Low Tointon, High Tointon, Mareham on the Hill, Roughton,
Haltham, Wood Enderby, Moorby, Wilksby, Mareham le Fen, and
Coningsby.&nbsp; To these have lately been added Langriville and
Thornton le Fen, portions of the fen district, which had been
sold by the commissioners appointed under an act of enclosure,
and rendered parochial by act of parliament in 1812.&nbsp; On the
enclosure of these fens, under the act which was obtained in
1801, the whole of the parishes in this soke, excepting the two
newly formed ones, had portions of land allotted to them, in lieu
of their right of common.</p>
<p>West Ashby, High Tointon, Mareham on the Hill, and Wood
Enderby, were formerly hamlets of the parish of Horncastle; but
have for several years been considered as distinct parishes, and
have appointed their own churchwardens and overseers of the
poor.</p>
<h3>THIMBLEBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Book Stimelbi, <a name="citation43"></a><a
href="#footnote43" class="citation">[43]</a> and in old writings
Thimelby, is about a mile north-west from Horncastle, the
parishes adjoining each other.&nbsp; The manor which in the reign
of Charles the second was the property of Sir Robert Bolles of
Scampton, is now possessed by Thomas Hotchkin, Esquire, of
Tixover, in the county of Rutland, in the <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>possession of
whose ancestors it has been for many years.&nbsp; In this parish
is also the manor of Hallgarth, which formerly belonged to a
family named Bolton; but is now the property of Richard Elmhirst,
Esquire, of Louth.&nbsp; The church rebuilt in the year 1744, is
a small stone edifice, possessing a considerable share of
architectural merit: a stone over the door points out the year in
which it was rebuilt, but besides this it exhibits no other
inscription. <a name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a>&nbsp; The advowson of the rectory
belongs to the lord of the manor.</p>
<h3>WEST ASHBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday called Aschebi, and in old writings Askeby, is a
parish adjoining to the north boundaries of that of Horncastle,
from which town the village is about two miles distant.&nbsp; In
this parish is the manor of Ashby Thorpe, now the property of Mr.
Joseph Rinder; but the possessor of that of Horncastle claims
manorial rights over the other parts of the parish.&nbsp; The
church consists of a tower, a nave with a north aisle, and a
chancel. <a name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a>&nbsp; The benefice is a curacy in the
presentation of the Bishop of Carlisle.</p>
<h3>LOW TOINTON,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Todingtune, and in old writings Nether Tointon, is
about a mile eastward from the town of Horncastle, the parishes
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>adjoining.&nbsp; The manorial estates, which comprise
nearly the whole parish are the property of Launcelot Rolleston,
Esquire, of Watnall, in the county of Nottingham, by whose
ancestors it has been possessed for several generations.&nbsp;
The church, which is a small modern erection, being rebuilt in
1811, contains a very curiously sculptured font, and the
following inscription on a plate of copper in the north wall:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Heare lyeth the Body of EDWARD ROLLESTON
Esquir who departed this Life the twenty-third of July in the
thirtey-fourth year of his age interr&rsquo;d underneath this
place the fourth of August Anno Domini 1687.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The patrons of the rectory are Lord Gwydir, and the Baroness
Willoughby of Eresby, his lady.</p>
<h3>HIGH TOINTON,</h3>
<p>In old writings Over Tointon, is about a mile and a half
eastward from Horncastle, to which parish and also that of Low
Tointon it adjoins.&nbsp; From only one place of this name being
mentioned in the Domesday record, it is probable that at the time
of making that survey both High and Low Tointon were included in
one parish.&nbsp; The manorial estates, which have descended with
those of Horncastle, belong to the Bishop of Carlisle, and are
leased to different individuals.&nbsp; The church is a small
uninteresting building.&nbsp; The Bishop of Carlisle is patron of
the curacy.</p>
<h3>MAREHAM ON THE HILL,</h3>
<p>Anciently written Maringe and Mayring, is about a mile and a
half south-east from Horncastle, the parishes adjoining each
other.&nbsp; The manor once belonged to Edward Marsh, Esquire, of
Hundle House, in the county of Lincoln, by a descendant of whom
it was sold to William Hudson, Esquire, of Gray&rsquo;s
Inn.&nbsp; In 1659 it was sold to a person named Duncome, of whom
it was purchased, in 1688, by Sir Edmund Turnor, of Stoke
Rochford, Knight, and is now possessed by his descendant of the
same names.&nbsp; The chapel is completely destitute of
interest.&nbsp; On repairing it, about fifteen years ago, two
nobles of Edward the fourth, two angels of Henry the seventh, and
several silver coins of different reigns, contained in a leathern
purse, were discovered concealed in the wall.&nbsp; The patron of
the curacy is the Bishop of Carlisle.</p>
<h3><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>ROUGHTON,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Rocstune, and in old writings Ructon, is about
four miles from Horncastle.&nbsp; The manorial estates belong to
Sir Joseph Banks.&nbsp; The church, which is a small building,
consisting of a tower nave and chancel, contains a marble tablet
on which is the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies the Body of NORREYS FYNES, Esq.
Grandson to Sir Henry Clinton, commonly called Fynes, eldest Son
of Henry Earl of Lincoln, by his Second Wife, Daughter of Sir
Richard Morrison, and Mother of Francis Lord Norreys, afterwards
Earl of Berkshire.&nbsp; He had by his much beloved and only Wife
Elizabeth, who lies by him, Twelve Children, of which Four Sons
and Two Daughters were living at his decease, which happened on
the 10th of January 1735&ndash;6 in the 75th year of his
age.&nbsp; From the Revolution he always liv&rsquo;d a Nonjuror,
which rendered him incapable of any other Publick Employment
(tho&rsquo; by his Great Abilitys and Known Courage equal to the
most Difficult and Dangerous) than that of being Steward to two
great Familys, wherein he distinguish&rsquo;d himself during his
Service of 40 years a most Faithful and Prudent Manager, of a
most Virtuous and Religious Life.&nbsp; His paternal Estate he
left without any addition to his Son <span
class="smcap">Kendal</span> his next heir.&nbsp; His eldest Son
<span class="smcap">Charles</span> was buried here the 26th of
August 1722, aged 36 years, whose Pleasant Disposition
adorn&rsquo;d by many virtues which he acquir&rsquo;d by his
Studys in Oxford made his death much lamented by all his
Acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There also occur two other tablets; one to the memory of the
Rev. Arthur Rockcliffe, who died in 1798, aged 71; the other to
the memory of Charles Pilkington, Esq. who died in 1798, aged 75,
and of Abigail his wife, who died in 1817, aged 80. <a

class="citation">[46]</a>&nbsp; The rectory, united to <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>that of
Haltham in 1741, is in the presentation of the Honorable Champion
Dymoke.</p>
<h3>HALTHAM,</h3>
<p>Called in the Domesday survey Holtham, is about five miles
distant from Horncastle.&nbsp; The manorial estates, which
comprise almost the whole of the parish, once belonged to the
Marmyons of Scrivelsby, and are now possessed by the Champion
Dymoke, a descendant of the female branch of that family.&nbsp;
The church, which appears to have suffered much from time, has in
its pristine state possessed a considerable share of
architectural merit.&nbsp; A large window at the eastern end
contains very fine tracery, and at one time, together with some
of the other windows, exhibited a large portion of stained glass,
of which only one piece, containing the arms of La Warre, is now
remaining. <a name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"

ENDERBY,</h3>
<p>In the Domesday record written Endrebi, is about five miles
distant from Horncastle.&nbsp; The manor is the property of Sir
Joseph Banks.&nbsp; The church is a small uninteresting
building.&nbsp; The Bishop of Carlisle is patron of the
curacy.</p>
<h3>MOORBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Morebi, is about five miles distant from
Horncastle.&nbsp; The manorial estates, comprising the principal
part of the parish, are the property of Sir Joseph Banks.&nbsp;
The church is totally destitute of interest.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Carlisle is the patron of the rectory.</p>
<h3>WILKSBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Wilchesbi, is about six miles distant from
Horncastle.&nbsp; The manor is the property of Sir Joseph
Banks.&nbsp; The church is a small modern erection.&nbsp; The
Champion Dymoke is patron of the rectory.</p>
<h3>MAREHAM LE FEN,</h3>
<p>In the Domesday book called Marun, and in old writings Marum,
is about seven miles distant from Horncastle, and situated on the
verge of the recently enclosed fenny district from whence it has
received its appellation.&nbsp; The manor is the property of Sir
Joseph Banks, by an ancestor of whom it was purchased, together
with the three before mentioned manors, above a century
ago.&nbsp; The manor house, which has for several years been
occupied by Mr. James Roberts, possesses from <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>its adjoining
gardens, a considerable share of interest.&nbsp; Having
accompanied Sir Joseph Banks, in the first voyage of Captain Cook
round the world, Mr. Roberts has sought to associate with the
rural simplicities of an English garden, such objects of
curiosity as a pleasurable recollection of those scenes had
furnished.&nbsp; In addition to numerous rustic and ornamental
seats, the gardens are embellished with huts resembling those of
Terra del Fuego and New Holland; and also a small museum of
curiosities, principally from the South Sea islands.&nbsp; A
visit to this spot is always an agreeable recreation.&nbsp; The
following sonnet was written after a visit here, by a native of
Jamaica.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear is the rural scene that Fancy loves,<br />
Where tuneful Rapture chants th&rsquo; enliv&rsquo;ning song,<br
/>
In wildest warblings to the darkling groves,<br />
Pouring in wildest mood the strains along;<br />
While Echo, from the leafy bowers among,<br />
Gives a soft cadence to the songster&rsquo;s tale,<br />
A mingled sweetness to the warbling throng,<br />
That comes in whispers on the balmy gale.<br />
These, Mareham, with thy spreading greenwood shade,<br />
Thy silent waters, and thy mossy cell,<br />
Breathe such a charm, that oft Delight has strayed,<br />
With ling&rsquo;ring steps, &rsquo;mid scenes she lov&rsquo;d so
well;<br />
And when fond Mem&rsquo;ry shall thy joys renew,<br />
She&rsquo;ll tell with musing voice her sweet, her last
adieu.</p>

<h3>CONINGSBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Cuningesbi, is a considerable village on the banks
of the river Bane, about eight miles from Horncastle.&nbsp; The
manor, which was once possessed by the Marmions of Wintringham,
has for many years belonged to the Heathcote family, and is now
the property of Sir Gilbert Heathcote, Baronet, of Normanton in
Rutlandshire.&nbsp; The church consists of a tower of excellent
masonry, a nave, two aisles and a chancel. <a

class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; The rectory, which is in the
presentation of the lord <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>of the manor, was for several years
held by the Reverend John Dyer, the poet.&nbsp; It was here that
he finished his didactic poem of &ldquo;The <a

lies buried in the church; but there is no inscription to
perpetuate his memory.</p>

<p>The lands composing these parishes were chiefly those sold by
the commissioners appointed under the act for draining and
enclosing Wildmore Fen; Langriville also contains the portion
allotted to the Earl of Stamford and Warrington, in lieu of his
manorial rights over Armtree and Wildmore.&nbsp; In 1812, an act
of parliament was passed rendering these lands, with others,
parochial, and approximating these two parishes to the soke of
Horncastle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village of Baumber or Bamburgh
is situated in the hundred of Gartree, about four miles northward
of Horncastle, on the turnpike road leading from that place to
Lincoln.&nbsp; In the Domesday survey it is called Badeburgh,
which perhaps may signify Bane burgh, or a town on the Bane, that
river forming the eastern boundary of the parish.&nbsp; At the
period of making that survey, Ulf and Gilbert de Gand are
mentioned as proprietors. <a name="citation55"></a><a

</a></p>
<p>The manor, together with the adjoining hamlet of Stourton
parva, once belonged to Thomas Dighton, Esquire, whose daughter
and heiress was married to Edward Clinton, second son of the
first Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; On failure of male issue in the
elder branch the earldom devolved to the son of this Edward,
whose successors afterwards had <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the Dukedom of Newcastle conferred on
them.&nbsp; These estates continued in the possession of this
family until the latter part of the last century, when they were
sold to Thomas Livesey, Esquire, of Blackbourn, in the county of
Lancaster, whose son, the present proprietor resides thereon, in
an elegant mansion, which was completed in 1810.&nbsp; Part of
the residence of the Earls of Lincoln is still standing.</p>
<p>The church at Baumber with all its appurtenances, and eight
oxgangs of land, were given by Gilbert de Gaunt to the monks at
Bridlington, which grant Pope Innocent the fourth and the Bishop
of Lincoln confirmed. <a name="citation56a"></a><a
href="#footnote56a" class="citation">[56a]</a>&nbsp; It is now a
donative, extrajudicial.&nbsp; It was rebuilt about sixty years
ago, and is a very neat brick structure, consisting of a tower, a
nave with side aisles, and a chancel. <a
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"
class="citation">[56b]</a>&nbsp; Under the chancel is the vault
of the Newcastle family, which was their place of sepulture
previous to disposing of their estates in this parish; but
although they still retain the church, none of the family have
been buried there since 1794.&nbsp; Over the vault are the
following inscriptions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lieth the Body of Francis Clinton
al&rsquo;s Fynes Esq. Grandson of Henry Lord Clinton Earl of
Lincoln who departed this life Feb. 5 Anno Dom. 1681.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here lieth the Body of Priscilla the Wife of Francis
Clinton al&rsquo;s Fynes Esq. who departed this life Febr. 15
Anno Dom. 1679.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the north aisle is a stone with this inscription around the
verge;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Orate p&rsquo; a&rsquo;iabs Joh&rsquo;es
Eland armig&rsquo;i Alicie et Elisabeth uxor ejusde&rsquo; qui

the number of houses to 51.</p>

Soke of Horncastle; <a name="citation57"></a><a

in the hundred of Gartree.&nbsp; It is very pleasantly situated
about two miles northward of Horncastle, near to the road leading
from that place to Lincoln.</p>
<p>The manorial estates comprising the chief part of the parish,
are the property of Richard Samuel Short, Esquire, a descendant
of a female branch of the family of that name, which he adopted
on coming into possession of the estates.&nbsp; The manor house,
the seat of the proprietor, though not of regular architecture,
acquires an agreeable effect from the grove in which it is
situated.&nbsp; From the house the prospect to the south-west,
over the adjacent level country, is both extensive and
pleasing.</p>

attention.&nbsp; The vicarage is in the gift of the Duchy of
Lancaster.&nbsp; The rectorial tythes belong to the grammar
school at Oakham, in the county of Rutland.</p>
<p>On under-draining a field in this parish, in the latter part
of the year 1819, several heaps of ox bones were dug up, and with
each heap an urn of baked clay, apparently of Roman manufacture;
but unfortunately none of the urns were taken up whole.&nbsp; To
account for these relics being found here, it is probable that on
this spot a Roman sacrifice had been celebrated, in honor of some
deity, on the occasion of a victory, or in the exercise of other
pagan rites.</p>
<p>Annexed to this parish is the hamlet or manor of Poolham,
anciently called Polum.&nbsp; It formed part of the barony of
Gilbert de Gaunt until about the thirty-fifth year of Edward the
first, when Robert de Barkeworthe died seized of it; <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a> and it appears to have been the
residence of Walterus de Barkeworthe, who died in 1374, and was
buried in the cloister of Lincoln cathedral.&nbsp; Afterwards it
was the residence of the family of Thimbleby, a branch of the
Thimblebys of Irnham, <a name="citation58b"></a><a
href="#footnote58b" class="citation">[58b]</a> who probably built
the mansion house within the ancient moat, about the time of
Henry the eighth.&nbsp; The Savilles of Howley in the County of
York, enjoyed the estate in the reign of Elizabeth, and in 1600,
Sir John Saville, Knight, sold it to George Bolles, Esquire,
citizen of London, whose descendant Sir John Bolles, Baronet,
conveyed the same to Sir Edmund Turnor, of Stoke Rochford,
Knight, and it is now the inheritance of Edmund Turnor, Esquire.
<a name="citation58c"></a><a href="#footnote58c"

<p>Within the moat, beside the mansion house, are the remains of
a chapel, built of stone, a font, and a grave-stone with the date
1527.</p>

Wollaton Nottinghamshire, and had issue Charles his heir, and
three other sons who died infants, and a daughter Susannah.&nbsp;

<p>The manorial estates, which comprise the whole parish, have
for many years been the property of a family named Burton.&nbsp;
The present proprietor is William Raynor Burton, Esquire, which
latter name he assumed on coming into possession of the estates
on the death of his uncle, Robert Burton, Esquire, of
Lincoln.</p>
<p>On the south side of the church, near to the porch, is an
elegant stone cross, which having escaped both the ravages of
time, and the destruction of the Puritans, remains in so perfect
a state as to be justly esteemed of unrivalled excellence and
beauty.&nbsp; The extreme height of it, including the subcourse,
is fifteen feet.&nbsp; The shaft is octagonal, and decorated with
a capital, surmounted by a coronal of small embattlements.&nbsp;
The cross, with its pediment, which rises from this, is
ornamented on the south face with the representation of the
crucified founder of the christian faith, and on the opposite
side with that of the virgin and child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> two miles south of

<p>At the time of compiling the Domesday survey, it appears that
part of this parish, then called Scrivelesbi, was annexed to the
Soke of Horncastle, which was then retained by the conqueror. <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a>&nbsp; By the same record, the manor
appears to have been then holden by Robert de Spenser, but by
what service is not said.&nbsp; How it passed from De Spenser to
the family of Marmyon; whether by inheritance, or escheat of the
crown, and subsequent grant, cannot now be ascertained.&nbsp; It
was however shortly after in the tenure of Robert Marmyon, whose
male descendants enjoyed the same until the twentieth year of
Edward the first, 1292, when Philip the last Lord Marmyon died
seized of this manor, holden by barony and the service of
champion to the kings <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>of England on their coronation day;
<a name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a> and seized also of the castle of
Tamworth in Warwickshire, held therewith as parcel of his barony,
but by the service of knight&rsquo;s fees, to attend the king in
his wars in Wales. <a name="citation63b"></a><a
href="#footnote63b" class="citation">[63b]</a>&nbsp; This Philip
had only female issue, and between them his great estates here,
in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and elsewhere, were
divided.&nbsp; By this partition, the manor and barony of
Scrivelsby were allotted to Joan, the youngest daughter, by whose
grand-daughter and heir the same passed in marriage to Sir John
Dymoke, who, with Margaret his wife, had livery thereof in the
twenty-third year of Edward the third.</p>
<p>At the coronation of Richard the second, Sir John Dymoke
claimed in right of his wife, to perform the office of champion;
but this right was counterclaimed by Baldwin Freville, who as
lord of Tamworth, also claimed to perform that service; but the
commissioners of the court of claims, deciding in favor of Sir
John Dymoke, he performed that office; and from that period to
the present time, nearly five hundred years, their male issue
have continued in possession of the same inheritance.&nbsp; The
present champion, Lewis Dymoke, Esquire, is the sixteenth of his
family, from Sir John Dymoke, who has inherited that high and
singular office.</p>
<p>The chief part of Scrivelsby Court, the ancient baronial seat,
was destroyed by fire, between fifty and sixty years ago.&nbsp;
In the part consumed was a very large hall, on the pannels of the
wainscottings of which were depicted the various arms and
alliances of the family, through all its numerous and far traced
descents.&nbsp; The loss has been in some degree compensated for,
by the addition which the present proprietor has recently made,
to those parts which escaped the ravages of the fire.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>The
church is a small building, consisting of a nave, with a north
aisle, and a chancel.&nbsp; At the eastern end of the aisle are
two tombs, on one of which is the figure of a knight, in chain
armour, cross-legged; on the other that of a lady, with a lion at
her feet.&nbsp; By the side of these is the tomb of Sir Robert
Dymoke, who was champion at the coronations of Richard the third,
Henry the seventh, and Henry the eighth; by the last of whom he
was made a knight banneret.&nbsp; On the top of the tomb is a
plate of brass, on which is sculptured his figure in full armour,
in a recumbent posture, with his helmet under his head, and a
lion at his feet.&nbsp; Above him is a shield, containing arms,
and under him is the following inscription:</p>

<h3>SITUATION, &amp;c.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Bolingbroke</span>, a decayed market town,
is distant about eight miles south east from Horncastle, and
gives name to the soke wherein it is situated.&nbsp; The town is
seated on a clear, rapid brook, from which the name is derived,
and which runs along a peculiar deep recess of rugged sand-stone
hills, which suddenly terminate at the northern border of the
adjacent fen district.&nbsp; Embayed amid these deep declivities,
and having but one narrow outlet into the level land, it is a
matter of no surprize that its importance as a place of security
was not overlooked in the feodal times, when it became further
strengthened by a castle.</p>

<h3>THE MANOR.</h3>
<p>The manor appears to have been, from an early period,
connected with the dignity of the Earldom of Lincoln.&nbsp;
Ranulph, an illustrious <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>nobleman, marrying Lucia, widow of
Roger de Romara, sister, and heiress of Morcar, the Saxon Earl of
Northumberland and Lincoln, delivered the estates, amongst which
was this lordship, to Henry the first, for the dignity of the
Earldom of Chester.&nbsp; Against this, William de Romara, son of
Lucia by her former husband, appealed to the king, but in
vain.&nbsp; William however strengthening by his interest the
rebellion in Normandy which had been raised by Robert, the eldest
son of the conqueror, and brother of the king, Henry, to appease
his wrath, and obtain his favor, was in the twenty-second year of
his reign, induced to restore to him the estates of his mother
Lucia, and invest him with the Earldom of Lincoln.&nbsp; About
the same time asserting the rights of the Empress Maud, in her
contentions with Stephen for the throne, he greatly contributed
to her early successes, particularly at the seige of
Lincoln.&nbsp; After this, exchanging certain lands in Normandy
with Robert de Tillol for the lordships of Hareby, Enderby, and
Hundleby, parts of this soke, William was invited by the security
of the situation, to erect his castle at Bolingbroke.</p>
<p>By his wife Maud, the daughter of Richard de Redvers, he had
issue a son named William, who married Hawise daughter of Stephen
Earl of Albemarle; but dying in the life time of his father, the
estates descended to his son, also called William.&nbsp; This
William, the third of that name, to further improve this
fortress, and add to the advantages of its situation, procured
from Simon Briton, who also held lands in these parts, remission
of all his claims in the whole marsh of Bolingbroke, and from
Jeffrey Fitz Stephens, the superior of the Knights Templar, a
full release of their interest in all the fens belonging to this
manor, and its soke, which William de Romara his grandfather had
given to them.</p>
<p>This last mentioned individual of the family of Romara died
without issue, and in him the male line of the family ceased, as
appears from Gilbert de Gaunt, after being a suppliant prisoner
when fighting on the side of Stephen at the siege of Lincoln, and
compelled by the first William de Romara to marry his daughter
Hawise, becoming in her right possessor of this manor, and
receiving also the Earldom of Lincoln.</p>
<p>Gilbert de Gaunt, died in the second year of the reign of
Henry <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>the
second, and left issue, two daughters, Alice and Gunnora; the
former of whom was married to Simon de St. Liz, Earl of
Huntingdon, who is said to have enjoyed, during her life time,
the Earldom of Lincoln, and with it this lordship.&nbsp; Alice as
well as her sister Gunnora dying without issue, their uncle
Robert de Gaunt, though unallied by blood, became their heir, and
possessed himself of these estates.&nbsp; Gilbert his son
succeeded him; but joining the cause of the barons against King
John, and afterwards against his son and successor, Henry the
third, he was defeated at Lincoln, taken prisoner, and these
estates conferred upon Ranulph de Meschines, surnamed de
Blundeville, Earl of Chester; who, being third in descent from
Ranulph Earl of Chester, by his wife Lucia, the widow of Roger de
Romara, and sister of Morcar the Saxon Earl of Lincoln, had,
independent of the claims on his sovereign for aiding in firmly
establishing his family on the throne, a natural right, superior
to that of the family of de Gaunt.&nbsp; Ranulph de Blundeville
dying without issue, his sisters became his co-heiresses; but he
had during his life time assigned by charter to one of them,
named Hawise, the Earldom of Lincoln, and with it this manor and
castle.</p>
<p>Robert, son and heir of Sayer de Quincy, Earl of Winchester,
marrying Hawise, left issue, a daughter, Margaret, who was
married to John de Laci, a descendant of the Barons of
Pontefract.&nbsp; John de Laci received from Henry the third a
charter of confirmation of the Earldom of Lincoln, and the
inheritances which he possessed by his wife Margaret de
Quincy.</p>
<p>Edmund his son dying before his mother, did not inherit the
Earldom, though he received the tertium denarium of the county:
he left issue, Henry, John, and Margaret, the former of whom
succeeded to this manor and the Earldom of Lincoln; and is said
to have been the most exalted nobleman of his time.&nbsp; He is
stated to have been illustrious in counsel, undaunted in the
fight, chief among the warriors of his country, and in fine, the
brightest ornament of the reign. <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a>&nbsp; His sons dying
young, he bequeathed by will all his possessions to the heirs <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>of Edmund
Plantagenet, in case of failure of issue by his daughter
Alice.&nbsp; Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, son of Edmund
Plantagenet, marrying Alice, held in her right, the estates of
her father Henry de Laci, who, on his death bed, desirous that
his son in law should be ennobled not only by the attendant
riches, but also by the influence of his example, enjoined him to
devote his power to secure the liberties of his country.&nbsp;
But the proud and resolute spirit of the Earl of Lancaster needed
no such injunctions to spur him on to action.&nbsp; Indignant
that Hugh de Spenser should enjoy the favor of his sovereign,
Edward the second, he after effecting the destruction of Piers
Gaveston, broke out into open rebellion: defeated however at
Boroughbridge, he was ignominiously put to death at his castle of
Pontefract, and his estates forfeited to the crown.&nbsp; The
inheritances which were, as has been before noticed, the right of
his wife, were still reserved to her; but having borne an
indifferent reputation for chastity, following the impulses of
her amours in the life time of her late husband, and after his
death marrying without the consent of the king to Eubold le
Estrange, the king with whom but trivial pretences were
sufficient for abridging the powers of any individual allied to
his haughty relatives of the house of Lancaster, seized for this
breach of fealty, or homage, all the inheritance which she held
of the crown in chief, among which were this manor, and that of
Denbigh, and conferred the whole on his favorite Hugh de
Spenser.</p>
<p>Henry, brother of Thomas the late Earl of Lancaster, procured
in the first parliament after the accession of Edward the third,
a remission of the forfeited estates of the family; and upon the
death of the countess Alice, the wife of his late brother, her
honors and splendid inheritances devolved to him, partly by the
will of her father Henry de Laci, and partly by reason of a
render made by him to Edward the first, and a re-grant by charter
from that monarch to the heirs of Henry de Laci, with remainder
to the heirs of Edmund Plantagenet.</p>
<p>Henry Earl of Lancaster died without male issue, but left two
daughters Maud and Blanche; the former of whom married William of
Bavaria, and left no issue; but Blanche became the sole heir of
her father, and married John of Gaunt, who, by reason of the
inheritances, <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>was created Duke of Lancaster.&nbsp; By her he had
issue, at the castle at this place, the celebrated Henry of
Bolingbroke; upon whose accession to the throne, the whole
patrimony through the line of Lancaster became invested in the
crown, and in his reign was counted one of the manorial
possessions of the king, denominated honors.</p>
<h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>
<p>On the south side of the town is the scite of the castle,
which is now only to be distinguished by the traces of its
foundations, encompassed by a moat.</p>
<p>The seclusion of this spot amongst steep hills, with only an
opening to the level country, southward, rendered it in the early
mode of warfare a desirable situation for a place of defence,
since it was at all times secure from the emergencies of a sudden
surprise.&nbsp; The advantages of such a situation were not
overlooked by William de Romara, who about the early part of the
reign of king Stephen, erected his castle at this place.</p>
<p>From the testimony of Mr. Gervase Holles, who is the only
person that has left us a description of this castle, it appears
to have been a very spacious square edifice, characterized in its
construction by strength and uniformity, and containing beside
numerous apartments, all the conveniences of warfare. <a
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; By Queen Elizabeth it was
improved by elegant and extensive erections, and though
afterwards neglected, yet <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>it remained a place of importance
down to the time of the civil wars in the reign of Charles the
first, when for some time it withstood a siege by the
parliamentary forces.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the royal army at Winceby, this castle was
compelled to yield to the army of the parliament, who, after
dismantling it, left it silently to decay.&nbsp; For a many years
part of a circular building, said to be the gate-house, continued
standing; but in May 1815, this last remaining fragment of the
once formidable structure fell to the ground.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>To the
east of the enclosure may be seen the entrenchments, behind which
the assailants, in 1643, protected themselves in their attack on
this castle.</p>
<h3>THE CHURCH.</h3>
<p>The church being occupied by the parliamentary forces when
they stormed the castle, was almost entirely demolished by the
cannon of that fortress.</p>
<p>The part now remaining, is situated a short distance north of
the scite of the castle, and consists of a tower, and a part
appropriated for public worship, which was once the southern
aisle of the original edifice.&nbsp; It is built of sand stone,
and if the delicate tracery of its windows be excepted, it
contains but little architectural beauty.&nbsp; These windows
were once ornamented with richly stained glass of which not a
fragment is now remaining. <a name="citation73"></a><a
href="#footnote73" class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>There
is yet preserved in this church the mutilated remains of an
embroidered cloth for the communion table, said to have been
wrought by one of the Duchesses of Lancaster.</p>
<p>Two chantries, which formerly were attached to this church,
were suppressed at the dissolution of religious houses, in the
twenty-sixth year of the reign of Henry the eighth.</p>
<p>The rectory is in the presentation of Lady Eyre of Mortlake,
in Surrey.</p>
<h3>THE TOWN.</h3>
<p>At so early a period as the time of forming the Domesday
survey, this town appears to have arisen into some consideration
as a place of trade, being possessed of a market, which however
is in that record denominated a new one. <a
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a></p>
<p>For a many years it was considered one of the principal market
towns of the county of Lincoln; but its trade, for some time
previous to the destruction of the castle, had been gradually
withdrawing to other places more conveniently situated; and
afterwards the town fell rapidly into decay, and its market
became wholly unfrequented.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>Although it may be at present identified as a mere
village; yet its widely detached houses, partially paved streets,
and grass grown market place, connected with the mounds of the
castle which once adorned the spot, evince sufficiently that
there has been a time when destitution was not the characteristic
of the town of Bolingbroke.</p>
<p>An unsuccessful attempt has lately been made to revive the
market, on a portion of land allotted to this parish on the
enclosure of the fens, in lieu of right of common thereon.&nbsp;
An annual fair on the tenth of July, is held both at this town
and on the fen allotment.</p>
<p>There is a free school at this place, founded and endowed in
1588, by a Mr. Chamberlain.</p>
<p>In 1811 this parish contained 75 houses, and 361
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke gives the title of viscount to the family of St.
John, of Lydiard Tregoze, in Wiltshire.</p>
<h2><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>REVESBY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Revesby</span> is situated at the distance
of six miles south from Horncastle, on the road from that place
to Boston, and is included in the soke of Bolingbroke.</p>
<p>What now constitutes the parish of Revesby, appears formerly
to have been three distinct manors, Revesby, Thoresby, and
Seithesby; the greater part of which was the property of William
de Romara, Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; In the year 1142 he founded a
Cistertian monastery at this place, and previous to endowing it
with the whole of his possessions here, he negotiated exchanges
with the other proprietors, by which he was enabled to give the
entirety of the three manors to his new monastery. <a

</a></p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>To add
to the solemnity of the ceremony of foundation, the Earl on this
occasion manumitted several slaves, who had petitioned for their
liberty.&nbsp; One of them, called Wilhelmus Medicus, was
doubtless a physician; another, Rogerus Barkarius, probably a
shepherd: the surnames of persons at that time being derived from
their profession.&nbsp; A person named Roger Barker resided until
lately at a place called Stickney Wydale.&nbsp; This place
belongs to the parish of Revesby, though about four miles
distant, and is supposed to have been given to the monks on
condition of their keeping Nordyke Causeway, formerly a dangerous
pass, in repair.</p>
<p>Beside the endowment of William de Romara, the monastery was
enriched by numerous other benefactions.&nbsp; At the dissolution
of religious houses, its possessions with all its rights were
granted to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk; and on the death of
his two infant sons, who survived him only a short time, their
extensive possessions were divided among the heirs general.&nbsp;
On this division, Revesby fell to the lot of the Carsey family,
who resided here several years, and afterwards sold it to the
Lord Treasurer Burleigh, from whom it descended to the first and
second Earls of Exeter; the latter of whom settled it on his
grandson Henry Howard, the third son of the Earl of
Berkshire.&nbsp; About a century ago it was sold by the
descendants of Henry Howard, to Joseph Banks, Esquire, the great
grandfather of the Right Honorable Sir Joseph Banks, Baronet, who
is the present possessor.</p>
<p>The seat of the proprietor was built by Craven Howard, nephew
and heir of Henry Howard; but has been much enlarged by the
family of Banks.&nbsp; Part of an ancient mansion, formerly the
residence of the abbots, now forms the offices.&nbsp; The
monastery, which stood at a considerable distance, has long been
entirely demolished.</p>
<p>The church, which is a small neat structure, was re-built by
the before mentioned Joseph Banks, Esquire.&nbsp; It is a
donative of exempt jurisdiction.</p>
<p>At the east end of the chancel is a tablet containing this
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dedicated to the Memmorie of NEHEMIAH
RAWSON, Esq.&nbsp; A Member of this Common Wealth, and a Justice

<p>At the same end is another tablet, with the following
inscription, and a shield containing a bend, in the sinister
chief three crosses fitchy:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On the north side of the chancel is a large marble monument,
surmounted by the bust of the individual whose memory it
perpetuates, and ornamented with a shield containing the arms of
<span class="smcap">Banks</span>, Sable, a cross or, between four
flowers de luce argent.&nbsp; This monument contains the
following inscription:</p>

<p>In this parish are two tumuli, each about one hundred feet
diameter, and about one hundred feet apart, which have been
formerly surrounded by a fosse.&nbsp; Dr. Stukeley supposes them
to have been either the places of sepulture of two British Kings,
or places of religious worship. <a name="citation79"></a><a

80</span>KIRKSTEAD.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Kirkstead</span>, anciently called
Cristed, is situated on the east bank of the Witham, in the
hundred of Gartree, and is about three miles distant from
Tattershall, and eight from Horncastle.&nbsp; Formerly it was a
hamlet of Kirkby super Bane, but for many years it has been
considered as a separate parish.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p80b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The manor, with that of Tattershall, was among the several
estates given by the conqueror to Eudo, one of his Norman
followers.&nbsp; His son Hugh fitz Eudo, called the Breton,
founded a Cistertian Abbey here in 1139, and endowed it with his
possessions in this place.&nbsp; Afterwards the monks,
considering the situation unhealthy, petitioned Robert, the son
of the founder, to allow them to remove the abbey to some other
place; but though they obtained permission, yet it does not
appear that the affair was proceeded in any further.&nbsp; The
abbey had subsequently many benefactors, and acquired very
extensive possessions.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>At the
dissolution of religious houses, the Kirkstead estate was given
by Henry the eighth, to Charles Duke of Suffolk; and on the
division of his estates after the death of his two sons, who
survived him but a short time, it reverted to the king as one of
the heirs general of the family, and was subsequently given to
Lord Clinton and Saye, afterwards Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; This
estate descended to Mr. Daniel Disney, in right of his wife
Catherine, the youngest daughter of Henry Fynes Clinton, Esquire,
and grand-daughter of the second Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; In the
year 1792 it was sold by Mr. Disney Fytch, grandson of Mr. Daniel
Disney, to the present possessor, Richard Ellison, Esquire, of
Sudbroke Holme, near Lincoln.</p>
<p>Of the Abbey a small ruin only remains: but from a plate of
&ldquo;The Ichnography of the Monastery of Kirsted Linc.&rdquo;
in Stukeley&rsquo;s Itinerarium Curiosum, the buildings appear to
have been extensive.</p>
<p>South of the ruin of the Abbey is the Chapel, a very curious
building, which according to tradition was built previous to the
monastery.&nbsp; It is of early English architecture, having
lancet windows at the sides and east end, and an ox-eye window
over the entrance at the west end.&nbsp; The roof is beautifully
groined, the ribs springing from corbel tables; and against the
south wall on the inside, is a rude figure in stone of a knight
templar, with the front part of his helmet in the shape of a
cross.&nbsp; For many years the roof of this building was covered
with thatch, but in 1790 it was removed and a covering of tiles
substituted.&nbsp; At that time also the bell, which had
previously hung in a tree, was placed over the west end of the
building.</p>
<p>This chapel is a donative of exempt jurisdiction, but appears
to have had no stipend for the officiating minister until it came
into the possession of Mr. Daniel Disney, who being a
presbyterian, appointed a minister of that persuasion to perform
service there, with a salary of &pound;30. per annum. <a
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a>&nbsp; In order that the tenets which he
professed might not want support in his parish, in 1720 he
settled certain lands upon five trustees, the profits of which
were to be applied to the <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>maintenance of a presbyterian
minister at this place.&nbsp; This gift he afterwards confirmed
by his will in 1732, and in addition, bequeathed to the trustees
the use of the chapel and chapel ground for the same
purpose.&nbsp; On the death or alienation of the minister, the
trustees were to present the names of two to the lord of the
manor, who was to appoint one of them, and on his neglect or
refusal, the trustees themselves were to make the
appointment.&nbsp; Ministers continued to be nominated by the
prescribed form until the death of Mr. Dunkley, who had for many
years received the bequeathed stipend, and whose demise took
place in 1794.&nbsp; On that occasion the present owner of the
manor took possession of the estates which had been conveyed to
the trustees, and appointed to the chapel a minister of the
Church of England, paying him &pound;30. per annum.&nbsp; The
trustees, however, recovered possession of the estates, by an
action of ejectment, tried at Lincoln summer assizes, 1812, but
not of the Chapel.&nbsp; Owing to some difficulties in the
arrangement of the affairs, the presbyterian form of worship is
not yet re-established here.</p>
<p>This village gave birth to the celebrated monk Hugh de
Kirkstead, who is styled by Fuller &ldquo;a Benedictine
Cistertian Bernardine Monk, or, as it may be termed a treble
refined Christian.&rdquo;&nbsp; He, and Serlo, one of his own
order, joined in composing a chronicle of the Cistertians from
their first arrival in England in 1131, to their own time, about
1210.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth volume of the &ldquo;Archeologia of the
Society of Antiquaries&rdquo; is an engraving of an ancient iron
candlestick of a very singular construction, six of which were
found in cleaning the bed of the river Witham near this
place.</p>
<p>This village contained, according to the returns of 1811, 26
houses and 110 inhabitants.</p>

<h3>THE MANOR.</h3>
<p>Shortly after the conquest, the lordship of Tattershall,
together with the hamlet of Tattershall Thorpe, and several other
estates, was <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>given by King William to Eudo and Pinso, two Norman
nobles, who had attended him into England, but who, though sworn
brothers in war, were not otherwise related.&nbsp; On the
division of the estates between these chieftains, this manor
became the property of Eudo, who fixed his residence here.&nbsp;
Upon his death his estates descended to his son, Hugh Fitz Eudo,
who, in the year 1139, founded an abbey for Cistertian monks at
the neighbouring village of Kirkstead.</p>
<p>Hugh was succeeded by his son Robert, who left issue a son
named Philip.&nbsp; Philip, after serving the office of sheriff
of Berkshire in the seventh year of the reign of Richard the
second, and also of Lincolnshire in the eighth, ninth and tenth
years of the same king, was succeeded by his son Robert, the
second of that name, who, in the year 1201, procured from King
John, by means of a present of a well-trained goshawk, a grant to
hold a weekly market on Thursday, on this manor.&nbsp; Robert was
followed by his son of the same name, who about the year 1230,
obtained from Henry the third a licence to build a castle at this
place, together with a grant of free warren in all his demesne
lands.&nbsp; The male line of Eudo was continued in regular
descent, by Robert the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh; upon
the death of the latter of whom in his minority, it became
extinct, and the inheritance was divided between his three
sisters.&nbsp; Tattershall became the portion of Joan, one of the
co-heiresses, who married Sir Robert Driby, and who had issue by
him a daughter and heiress Alice, afterwards married to Sir
William Bernack.&nbsp; John, the son of this latter marriage, was
succeeded by William, who died a minor, and left his sister Maud
his heiress.</p>
<p>The Fitz Eudos, from the place, assumed the cognomen of
Tateshall, and by that title had summons to parliament among the
great barons of the realm.</p>
<p>Maud, the heiress of the Bernack family, married Sir Ralph,
afterwards Lord Cromwell, who, in her right, became lord of this
manor; and upon his death, which happened on the twenty-seventh
day of August in the year 1398, left his son Ralph his heir, who
died in 1416, and was succeeded by a son of the same name.&nbsp;
In the year 1433, this latter Ralph was by Henry the sixth
appointed Treasurer of the Exchequer.&nbsp; He died without issue
on the fourth of January, <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>1455; whereby his two nieces, the
daughters of his sister, the wife of Sir Richard Stanhope, became
his co-heiresses.</p>
<p>It does not appear into whose hands the Tattershall estate
fell after the death of the Lord Treasurer Cromwell, until the
year 1487, when Henry the seventh granted the manor to his
mother, Margaret, Countess of Richmond, and in the following year
entailed it on the Duke of Richmond.&nbsp; The Duke dying without
issue, Henry the eighth in 1520, granted it to Charles Duke of
Suffolk, by letters patent, which were confirmed by Edward the
sixth, in the year 1547.</p>
<p>On the death of the two infant sons of the Duke of Suffolk,
who survived their father only a short time, this manor again
came into the possession of the king as one of the heirs general
of the family.&nbsp; By letters patent, dated the fifth of
September, 1551, Edward the sixth granted the castle with the
manor, in fee, to Edward Lord Clinton and Saye, afterwards Earl
of Lincoln.&nbsp; The Earl dying in 1584, was succeeded by his
son Henry, who died in 1616, leaving issue a son and heir Thomas,
who survived his father only two years, and was followed by his
son Theophilus, who died in 1667.&nbsp; The next possessor was
Edward, who was the grandson of Theophilus, and who died at
Tattershall in 1692; in him terminated the male line of the
Clinton family.&nbsp; Upon his death, without issue, the
Tattershall estate became the property of his cousin Bridget, who
married Hugh Fortescue, Esquire, by whom she had a son and heir
Hugh, created in 1746, Baron Fortescue, and Earl Clinton.&nbsp;
Upon his death in 1751, his half brother Matthew succeeded him,
but dying in 1785, the Tattershall estate descended to his eldest
son Earl Fortescue, the present possessor.</p>
<p>Besides the liberties of the parks, chases and free warrens,
belonging to the castle and manor of Tattershall, it also appears
in the several grants of Henry the third, Henry the fourth, Henry
the seventh, Henry the eighth, and in the grant of the liberties
of Richmond fee, whereof the castle and manor of Tattershall is a
part, that to the said castle and manor also belong the liberties
of stallage, tolls of markets and fairs, together with the
privilege for all tenants and inhabitants of Tattershall to be
discharged of any tolls in fairs and markets abroad; also the
sole liberties of fishing, fowling, hawking, and hunting, in all
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>the said
manors, chases and the precincts of them; also suits of courts
baron, waifs, estrays, treasure trove, goods and chattels of
felons, fugitives, men outlawed, and felones de se, deodands,
bondmen, villains, with their sequels; and also that neither the
sheriff of the county, nor his bailiff shall arrest within the
said manor, and that no distress taken therein shall be
delivered, nor replevins granted by the sheriff, but only by the
steward of the lord of the said manor.</p>
<h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>
<p>About two hundred and fifty yards south-west of the town
stands the remains of the castle, a stately edifice, erected by
the Lord Treasurer Cromwell, about the year 1440.</p>
<p>William of Worcester states, that the Lord Treasurer expended
in building the principal and other towers of this castle above
four thousand marks; his household there consisted of one hundred
persons, and his suite, when he rode to London, commonly of one
hundred and twenty horsemen; and his annual expenditure was about
&pound;5000. <a name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a"
class="citation">[86a]</a></p>
<p>This castle was originally intended as a place of defence, and
was surrounded by two fosses, the inner one faced with brick,
great part of which is now remaining.&nbsp; Formerly it was of
great extent, but was dilapidated in the civil wars between the
unfortunate Charles the first and his parliament: for the damages
thereby sustained, Theophilus, fourth Earl of Lincoln, petitioned
parliament in the year 1649.</p>
<p>The part now remaining, is a rectangular brick tower of
exquisite workmanship, about one hundred feet in height, divided
into four stories, and flanked by four octagonal turrets; and is
raised on ponderous arches, forming spacious vaults, which extend
through the angles of the building, into the bases of the
turrets. <a name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a>&nbsp; Under the crown of these vaults
was a deep well, which is now filled up.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The walls are of great thickness, particularly that on the
east side, in which are several galleries and narrow rooms,
arched in a curious <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>manner, through which communications were obtained with
the principal apartments in the several stories, from the great
stairs in the south-east turret.&nbsp; The east wall also
contains the chimnies.</p>
<p>The windows are of the pointed order, well-proportioned, and
contain tracery; those on the south, west and north sides are
large, and from them the principal apartments received light;
those on the east are smaller, being designed to give light only
to the rooms and galleries in that wall.</p>
<p>The main walls were carried to the top of the fourth story,
where the tower was covered by a grand platform, or flat roof,
which, together with the several floors, is entirely
destroyed.&nbsp; Surrounding this part of the tower are very deep
machicolations, upon which, and part of the main walls, is a
parapet of great thickness, with arches, intended to protect the
persons employed over the machicolations.&nbsp; Upon these arches
is a second platform, enclosed with a parapet and embrasures;
above which the embattled turrets rise to a considerable height;
three of them terminating in cones covered with lead.&nbsp; The
cone of the fourth turret is demolished.</p>
<p>On the ground floor is an elegantly carved stone chimney
piece, embattled, and ornamented alternately with arms, and
treasury purses with the motto &ldquo;nay je droit.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Between the castle and the church stands an ancient brick
building, which, from the stile of architecture, appears to be
coeval with the castle, and is now inhabited.&nbsp; On the west
of the castle is another remain, apparently of the same
date.&nbsp; Each of these buildings is situated between the outer
and inner fosse.</p>
<p>The principal entrance to the castle, with its portcullis and
towers, was standing at the north-east corner of the enclosure,
when Buck made his drawing in 1726.</p>
<h3>THE COLLEGIATE CHURCH.</h3>
<p>In the seventeenth year of the reign of Henry the sixth, a
licence was obtained from that monarch, directed to Ralph
Cromwell, Knight, Henry Bishop of Winchester, Cardinal of
England, William Alnewick, Bishop of Lincoln, John Scroope,
Knight, Walter Hungerford, Knight, Walter Talbois, Esquire, and
William Paston, <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>patrons of the parish church of Tattershall, in the
county of Lincoln, empowering them to convert the said church,
into a collegiate church or college, in honour of the Holy
Trinity, the blessed Virgin Mary, St. Peter the Apostle, St. John
the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist.&nbsp; The establishment
was to consist of seven chaplains, one of whom to be custos or
master, six secular clerks, and six choristers.&nbsp; The licence
further authorized them to erect a perpetual alms-house on their
own ground, being parcel of the castle and manor of Tattershall,
next to the church-yard, containing ten acres, for thirteen poor
persons of both sexes; with mansion houses and buildings for the
said master, chaplains, clerks, choristers and their servants;
with cloisters, enclosures, gardens, orchards and all other
conveniences; and to assign the same to the said master and
chaplains; who were to be a body corporate, and have a common
seal for the execution of all business, with power to sue and be
sued, and to purchase, receive and hold lands, tenements, and
other revenues, ecclesiastical or secular, to the value of
&pound;200. per annum, over and above the advowson and yearly
value of the said church of Tattershall, and the houses and ten
acres of land aforesaid, without fine or fee to the king or his
heirs.</p>
<p>The Lord Treasurer, in pursuance of this licence, began to
convert the parish church into a college; but it appears that he
died before it was finished, as, by his will, dated a short time
previous to his decease, he bequeathed his body to be buried in
the collegiate church of Tattershall, until the whole fabrick
should be rebuilt, and then to be removed into the midst of the
choir.</p>
<p>The church was afterwards finished nearly as it remains at
this time; and mansion houses and other necessary buildings were
erected for the use of the foundation, as well as the alms houses
mentioned in the licence.&nbsp; Among the inscriptions in the MS.
of Lincolnshire Church Notes, taken by Mr. Gervase Holles, are
the names of several persons who belonged to this
establishment.</p>
<p>This college received several benefactions, and its
possessions progressively increased to a considerable
magnitude.&nbsp; In the thirty-sixth year of Henry the eighth,
the whole was granted to Charles, Duke of Suffolk, who at that
time was possessor of the castle and manor.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>The
church stands about eighty yards east of the castle, near the
outer fosse, and is a beautiful and spacious stone structure in
the form of a cross, consisting of a square tower, a nave with
five arches on a side, and eight clerestory windows placed in
pairs, a transept, and a choir.&nbsp; On the north side is a
porch, on which are sculptured the arms of William of Wainflete,
Bishop of Winchester: formerly there were two porches on the
south side also bearing the arms of the same bishop; but these
have been some time since removed.&nbsp; Over the great eastern
window is a richly ornamented niche, in which a statue once
stood: the wall above the western door is likewise ornamented
with thirteen blank shields.&nbsp; The cloisters, which were on
the south side of the chancel, are entirely demolished.</p>
<p>In the south wall of the chancel are three stone stalls and a
piscina, with a cornice charged with various animals; on each
side of the transept is also a piscina.&nbsp; There is a handsome
rood-loft between the nave and choir, now used as a singing
gallery.</p>
<p>The windows of the choir were once enriched with beautiful
stained glass, which was removed in the year 1754, by the Earl of
Exeter, on condition that it should be replaced with plain glass:
but this being neglected to be done, the choir remained about
fifty years with unglazed windows; and being thus exposed to the
weather, the elegantly carved oak stalls, the rich screens, and
other ornamental work, fell entirely to decay. <a
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; The choir has, within these few
years, been repaired by the present Earl Fortescue, and fitted up
in a plain but neat manner.</p>
<p>The windows of the nave and transept were also enriched with
stained glass containing the legendary histories of St. Guthlake,
St. Catherine, and other saints, a few fine fragments of which
are preserved in two of the transept windows.</p>
<p>On the floor before the communion table is a stone which once
contained a rich brass figure of the Lord Treasurer Cromwell,
habited <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>in
full plated armour and a flowing mantle and cordon, the gauntlets
reaching to the middle joint of the fingers, a long sword across
him from the middle of the belt, and at his feet two wild men
with clubs his supporters; by his side the figure of Margaret his
wife; and over them a canopy charged with saints, and under them
the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet nobilis Baro Radulphus Cromwell
Miles D&rsquo;ns de Cromwell quo&rsquo;dm Thesaurarius Anglie et
fundator hujus Collegii cum inclita consorte sua Margareta una

</blockquote>
<p>The whole of these figures, the canopy, and the arms are gone
and only half the inscription is now remaining.</p>
<p>On the north side of the Lord Treasurer, is the figure in
brass of Joan Lady Cromwell, <a name="citation91a"></a><a
href="#footnote91a" class="citation">[91a]</a> under a canopy
adorned with saints, and under her this inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Orate p&rsquo; a&rsquo;ia Johanne

mill&rsquo;mo cccclxxix cuj&rsquo; a&rsquo;ie

</blockquote>
<p>On the other side of the Lord Treasurer is the figure in brass
of Matilda Lady Willoughby, <a name="citation91b"></a><a
href="#footnote91b" class="citation">[91b]</a> under a canopy
charged with saints, and at her feet the following
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet d&rsquo;na Matilda nuper

militis ac consanguinea et heres illustris d&rsquo;ni Radulphi

</blockquote>
<p>The corner shields from this stone, and also those from that
of <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Joan
Lady Cromwell are gone. <a name="citation92a"></a><a
href="#footnote92a" class="citation">[92a]</a>&nbsp; The canopies
have sustained but little injury.</p>
<p>In the middle of the floor of the choir is the figure in brass
of a priest, under which is the following inscription to the
memory of William Moor, the second provost of this college:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vir virtute vivens Will&rsquo;us vulgo
vocatus<br />
Hujus Collegii de Tateshale secundus<br />
Hic Eboracensis fuit eccl&rsquo;ie cathedralis<br />

</blockquote>
<p>A brass figure of a priest, about five feet long, with the
figure of the deity on his breast, and several saints down his
robe, is now loose in the choir.&nbsp; Mr. Gough, in his
&ldquo;Sepulchral Monuments,&rdquo; describes this as the figure
of William Moor, and attached to the above inscription. <a
name="citation92b"></a><a href="#footnote92b"
class="citation">[92b]</a></p>
<p>On the floor between the nave and the choir is a brass figure
much worn, under which, though scarcely legible, is this
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Hugo . . . quondam . . .

href="#footnote92c" class="citation">[92c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>In
various parts of the floor of this church are traces of brass
figures, which are now gone, one, in particular, against the door
in the north aisle appears to have been exceedingly rich.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>The
south side of the transept is now partitioned off, and used as a
school, in which the children are instructed on the plan of Dr.
Bell.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>The
living is a donative, extra judicial, in the presentation of the
lord of the manor.&nbsp; It was once held by the Reverend Obadiah
How, D.D. a man of considerable learning, and the author of
several theological treatises; he died in 1685, and was buried in
the church of Boston, of which he was vicar.&nbsp; It was
afterwards held for more than forty years by the Reverend Michael
Taylor, who died in 1730, and was buried in the midst of the nave
of this church.</p>
<p>The college, which was situated on the north side of the
church, is entirely gone.&nbsp; The alms-houses still remain with
a small endowment.</p>
<p>An old building in the town, supposed to have been the parish
chapel, now forms part of a malting office.</p>
<h3>THE TOWN.</h3>
<p>The parish of Tattershall contains about 1555 acres of land,
and the hamlet of Tattershall Thorpe about 2589 acres, the
principal part of which is the property of the lord of the
manor.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>The
town has derived considerable benefit from the navigable canal,
which passes through it from the river Witham to the town of
Horncastle.&nbsp; A fine bridge of four arches having been thrown
over the Witham, in the place of the ferry, with a turnpike road
to Sleaford, has also contributed to the improvement of the
place.</p>
<p>From a manuscript account of the diocese of Lincoln, taken in
the year 1588, it appears that at that period Tattershall
contained 236 families, and the hamlet of Tattershall Thorpe
68.&nbsp; By the returns made in the year 1811, it appears that
the number of houses in Tattershall was 105, and of inhabitants
506: Tattershall Thorpe, at the same time, contained 37 houses
and 208 inhabitants.</p>
<p>There are two fairs holden annually at this place; one on the
fifteenth of May, the other on the twenty-fifth of
September.&nbsp; The market is now held on Friday weekly.</p>
<p>In the market place stands an octagonal column or shaft, which
was once surmounted by a cross.&nbsp; The cross has however long
since been removed and an urn substituted in its place.&nbsp; On
three of the shields with which this column is ornamented these
arms are sculptured, viz. <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>,
<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> and <span
class="smcap">Tateshall</span> quarterly, and <span
class="smcap">Cromwell</span> and <span

class="smcap">Deincourt</span>.&nbsp; The arms on the fourth
shield are obliterated.</p>

ON THE MOOR.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> an extensive moor, about four
miles north of Tattershall, and about six miles south west of
Horncastle, stands the remain of a brick building, called from
its situation the <i>Tower on the Moor</i>.&nbsp; It was built by
the Lord Treasurer Cromwell, and is supposed to have been an
appendage to the castle at Tattershall, from which place it is
plainly visible by reason of the flatness of the intervening
country. <a name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"

<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Of this
tower only an octangular turret remains, to which fragments of

<h2><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SOKE AND
NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HORNCASTLE.</h2>
<h3>GEOLOGY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Soke of Horncastle
does not possess much variety in its geological structure, yet a
considerable diversity is to be found in the formation of the
adjacent elevated country, called the wolds.&nbsp; On the annexed
map the denudations of the various strata in this district are
traced out, and distinguished by different colours: the order of
stratification is also exemplified by a section, of imaginary
elevation, but on the same scale as the map with respect to
horizontal distance.&nbsp; The section too shows a greater extent
than the map to the east, where, on account of the dip of the
strata towards that quarter, it is necessary to commence the
description, although in point of distance it cannot be properly
considered within the prescribed limits of this work.</p>
<p>The tract of marsh land between the sea and the wolds, (No.
1.) consists principally of unstratified clay, with admixtures of
sand, and various marine depositions.&nbsp; These circumstances,
together with the old sea banks, evidence that this mass of earth
has been left by the gradual receding of the ocean.</p>
<p>On the west of these marshes is the rough elevated denudation
of chalk, (No. 2.) which forms the highest stratum of the wolds,
and gently dips underneath the marshes; for in boring in them for
water the chalk is always found.&nbsp; The chalk is of two
colours, white and red, each lying in regular strata, which
alternate frequently, the red bearing <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>but a small proportion to the
white.&nbsp; In the white, compact seams of flint, of a light
grey color, from two to six inches thick, are often met
with.&nbsp; In the chalk several extraneous fossils are
found.</p>
<p>The stratum immediately below the chalk, (No. 3.) is a coarse,
brown, pebbly sand, consisting of quartz and oxyd of iron,
varying in thickness from six to ten yards, and of uncertain
appearance at its denudation.&nbsp; While the different strata in
these parts were exposed to the action of the water, the sand
would naturally be more affected by that element than the
superincumbent stratum of chalk; and the latter being thus left
projecting, would from the decomposing effects of the atmosphere,
crumble down, and form those various declivities which now
present themselves to view.</p>
<p>Beneath the sand is a bed, about fourteen yards in thickness,
(No. 4.) containing equal proportions of oolite limestone and
calcareous clay of a light grey colour.&nbsp; In some parts the
stone is divided by the clay into regular strata, whilst in
others it occurs in large detached pieces imbedded in the
clay.&nbsp; Fossil shells, and lumps of pyrites, or sulphuret of
iron, are frequently met with in the stone.</p>
<p>The next stratum (No. 5.) consists of grains of quartz, for
the most part agglutinated into sandstone of different degrees of
induration, and varying in colour from a light grey to a dark
brown, whilst in some parts loose sand predominates.&nbsp; In the
grey variety of this stone, marine shells of different kinds, are
found in great abundance: in the brown they occur very seldom,
and not at all in the sand.&nbsp; This stratum is considerably
thicker than the two incumbent ones.</p>
<p>The lowest visible stratum is the shale, <a
name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a> (No. 6.) which generally makes its
appearance in vallies.&nbsp; As it no where exhibits a denudated
termination, its thickness cannot be estimated, but from the
great depths in which it has been bored, without being
perforated, it must be immense. <a name="citation100b"></a><a
href="#footnote100b" class="citation">[100b]</a>&nbsp; A great
variety of organic remains are also found in this stratum.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>The
last division to be considered is an alluvial collection of
earth, almost entirely consisting of the spoils of the
neighbouring strata in a state of decomposition, wherein however
detached pieces of the different strata are to be found
unaltered.&nbsp; From this it appears that when these parts were
deluged by the water, the current set in from east to west.&nbsp;
As the chalk and the shale would present the largest surfaces to
the erosion of the water, they would be more extensively acted
upon than the other strata: hence the greatest part of the
alluvial deposition consists of white marle and blue; the former
(No. 7.) being of the least specific gravity, has covered the
hills, while the latter with sand gravel (No. 8.) occupies the
lower parts.</p>
<h3>NATURAL HISTORY.</h3>
<p>In the department of Natural History, this district possesses
but little which is deserving of particular notice.&nbsp; Of
birds there are none which can now be considered peculiar to this
part, the drainage of the fen lands having entirely banished the
great variety of aquatic birds which used, previous to that
event, to be found here.</p>
<p>A variety of plants, many of which are of rare occurrence in
other parts, are indigenous to this neighbourhood: a list of them
is given in the following table.</p>

<p><i>The Division of Wildmore Fen</i>, <i>between the Baronies
of Bolingbroke</i>, <i>Horncastle</i>, <i>and
Scrivelsby</i>.&nbsp; <i>From the Fenman&rsquo;s Vade
Mecum</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Abbot and Covent of Kirkstead
have right and Lordship in the Maris which is called Wildmore, as
by their antient and manifest instruments in writeing doth
appeare.&nbsp; And for that their right and l&rsquo;b&rsquo;tie
may more planly be known unto the world, it behoveth that the
declaring thereof by antient times and dayes be more manifested
and opened.&nbsp; Be it therefore knowne, that the said Marris
Ground called Wildmore is p&rsquo;tinent and belonging to three
Barronnies, that is to say, Bullingbrooke, Horncastle, and
Scrivelsbie: the said whole Marris Ground in antient time was
called Wildmore, that is to say, in the time of Stephen, late or
sometime King of England; and in the fourth yeare of his raigne
was founded the Abby of Kirkstead, by the progeinto<sup>rs</sup>
and fowndo<sup>rs</sup> of Tattershall; and in the eight yeare of
the raigne of the said King Stephen was founded the Abbey of
Reavesby, by William Romar, Earl of Lincoln, which William did
give the house of Kerxe com&rsquo;on of pasture in Wildmore, as
much as to him and to the lands he had did appertaine; these
things being ended and finished before the great and generall
battells and warres, the said King Stephen died, after whome
succeeded King Henry, who when he retayned in his owne hands two
of the said Barronies, that is to say, Scrivelsby and Horncastle,
he did give unto the said house of Kerxe, the Hermitage of
Wildmore, with a certaine pasture thereunto belonging.&nbsp; And
in pr&rsquo;cesse of time the said King did give the Barronary of
Horncastle unto Gerbald Skalde, of Fland<sup>rs</sup>, and the
Barronary of Scrivelsby unto Rob<sup>te</sup> Marmyon, a Norman:
theise two Barrons did after give unto the said house of Kirks by
their writings com&rsquo;on of pasture in Wildmore, on condition
they should suffer no man to com&rsquo;on with them in the said
Wildmore, but only themselves and theire tennants.&nbsp;
Will&rsquo;m of Romar Earl of Lincoln after being dead, the gift
which he made unto the said house of Kirks, Will&rsquo;m of
Romar, his nephew and his heir, did by his writeing confirme his
said uncle&rsquo;s gift unto the said howse.&nbsp; And after him,
Ralfe Earle of Chester did likewise confirme by his deed of
gifte.&nbsp; At length contenc&rsquo;on fell amongst the said
Barrons for the said Wildmore, for that none of them did know
what or how much did appertaine of the said Wildmore to every of
their Barronaries, wheruppon division was made between the Barron
of Bullingbrooke and the Barron of Horncastle and Scrivelsbie, in
the said Marris; that the men of the Barronry of Bullingbrooke
might quietly com&rsquo;on in their owne feudal com&rsquo;ons,
and the men of Horncastle and Scrivelsby in theire p&rsquo;ts,
which said division was made in the time of the said Will&rsquo;m
Romar the elder, in this manner.&nbsp; It is ordained betwene the
Sookes and the assent of their Lords and their tennants, that
eight of the most wisest, discreetest, and <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>antientest
of the same Sookes, should walk and view the same Marris, and
make division thereof amongst the said Sookes, which said eight
men were chosen by the assent of the said Sookes.&nbsp; That is
to say, four in the soke of Horncastle and Scrivelsby, that is to
say, Goodricke of Cunningsby, grave of Wildmore for the space of
forty yeares, Brodericke the father of Algar, Gericke, an ould
and reverend man, Recell son of Utenker; and foure of the Sooke
of Bullingbrooke, Walter of Keale, Henry of East Kirkby, Gunford
of Smerhurne, and Hiver of Miningsby.&nbsp; These eight men set
downe the stones and markes in forme as followeth, that is to
say, beginning at Fillward mere, distant a little from mere end,
and there setting up a redd marke, proceeded directly behind
Newham, waveing the same on the left hand, from thence unto
Ellmere pitt, and All garr more, and soe directly unto Maple
buske under Sherwood.&nbsp; And whatsoever was in the East part
app&rsquo;teined unto the Soake of Bollingbrooke, and whatsoever
was in the West part apperteined unto Horncastle and
Scrivelsby.&nbsp; All theise were renewed in the time of Ralfe
Earle of Chester.&nbsp; Terebald of Scalde aforesaid, being dead,
succeeded him as Barron of Horncastle.&nbsp; After which
succeeded Gered of Rhodes, a worthy and valiant knight; after him
succeeded Ralfe of Rhodes, Lord of Horncastle, who, contrary to
the grants of his ancesto<sup>rs</sup>, did bring in the said
Wildmore other mens cattell, whereup&rsquo;n a plea of covent was
sued against the said Ralfe of Rhodes, by the Abbot and Covent of
Kirkstead, in the court of our souvraigne Lord the King, and a
fyne knowledged by the said Ralfe of Rhodes, wherein was
contayned, that the said Ralfe did give for him and his heires
unto the said Abbot and Covent of Kirkstead all his right and
l&rsquo;b&rsquo;tie which he claimed to have, or might have by
any manner of meanes in Wildmore.&nbsp; That is to say, in
meadowes, pastures, and feedings, and in all other man&rsquo;er
of proffitts, easm<sup>ts</sup>, lib&rsquo;ties, customes, and in
all other things, without reteining of any thing, saveing and
reserving to himselfe and his heires, and his men, pasture in
Wildmore, and turbary to be had and taken to their only use and
uses, and not to be given or sold to any others.&nbsp; The same
Ralfe hath alsoe given unto the said howse of Kirkstead all his
lordship and right in Wildmore, as appeareth by his graunt.&nbsp;
Furthermore, Rob<sup>t</sup> Marmyon, Lord of Scrivelsby, being
dead, succeeded after him Rob<sup>te</sup>, his sonne.&nbsp; This
Rob<sup>te</sup>, after the death of his father, likewise
contrary to the graunt of his ancestors, did bring into the said
Com&rsquo;on of Wildmore other mens cattell, whereupon the like
plea of covent was sued against the said Rob<sup>te</sup>,
whereunto he did appeare, and did knowledge aff&rsquo;yne to the
said Abbot and Covent in the same court, the same conteining in
effect the same words before menc&rsquo;oned: from which time
until this p&rsquo;sent, whereby the said Abbotts and Covents of
Kirkstead, in impoundm<sup>ts</sup>, and all other lib&rsquo;ties
and customes, have bene Lords of Wildmore, and peaceably and
quietly have enjoyed the same as true Lords thereof, without
impedim<sup>te</sup> of any man.</p>

the distance of about four miles from Horncastle, leading nearly
in a straight line to Caistor, and from thence to the Humber: it
bears the name of the <i>High Street</i>, and several tumuli are

Burnham in Buckinghamshire, educated at Eton, and elected a
scholar of King&rsquo;s college, Cambridge, in 1507, where he
took the degree of M.A. afterwards became proctor of the
university, schoolmaster of Eton, fellow of the college, and at
length provost.&nbsp; In 1523 he was one of those who were sent
out by the university of Cambridge to preach in different parts
of the nation, as the judges now go their circuits.&nbsp; In 1529
he retired to Oxford, where he was incorporated B.D.&nbsp; About
the same time he was made archdeacon of Colchester.&nbsp; In 1534
he was installed canon of Windsor, and the same year he was
appointed register of the most noble order of the garter.&nbsp;
July 18, 1537, he was consecrated bishop of Carlisle.&nbsp; He
was a correspondent of Erasmus, who termed him when young,
&ldquo;bland&aelig; eloquenti&aelig; juvenis,&rdquo; and appears
to have associated with him during his residence at
Cambridge.&nbsp; Leland was his familiar acquaintance, and gives
him a high character for parts and learning.&nbsp; He was the
author of a volume of epigrams, and several theological
treatises.</p>

here stiled the arch-rebel, although at the time mentioned he was
only a colonel, and by no means an illustrious individual in the
war.&nbsp; The date given to the battle is wrong, it having been
fought on the 11th of October; and the signal defeat of the
royalists is diminished in its importance, by stiling the
conflict a skirmish.</p>

<p><a name="footnote71"></a><a href="#citation71"
class="footnote">[71]</a>&nbsp; The MS. vol. of Church notes, so
often before quoted, contains the following description of this
castle:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The castle of Bullingbrooke was built by
William de Romara Earle of Lincolne, and ennobled by the birth of
King Henry the 4th, who from thence took his sirname.&nbsp;
Heretofore it was a famous structure, but now gone much to ruine
and decay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The towne standes in a bottome, and the castell in the
lowest part of it, compassed about with a large moat fed by
springs.&nbsp; It is most accessible on the south-west part, the
rest being encompassed by the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the frame of the building, it lieth in a square,
the area within the walls conteyning about an acre and a half,
the building is very uniforme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hath 4 stronge forts or ramparts, wherein are many
roomes, and lodgings: the passage from one to another lying upon
the walles, which are embattled about.&nbsp; There be likewise 2
watch-towers all covered with lead.&nbsp; If all the roomes in it
were repayred, and furnished [as it seemes in former tymes they
have bin] it were capable to receyve a very great prince with all
his trayne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entrance into it is very stately over a faire
draw-bridge.&nbsp; The gatehouse a very uniforme, and strong
building.&nbsp; Next within the porter&rsquo;s lodge is a payre
of low stayres, which goe downe into a dungeon, in which some
reliques are yet to be seene of a prison-house.&nbsp; Other 2
prisons more are on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building itselfe is of a sandy stone hewen of a
great square out of the rockes thereby, which though it abide the
weather longe, yet [in processe of tyme] it will moulder,
especially if wett gett within it, which hath bin the decay of
many places of the wall where the roofe is uncovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be certaine roomes within the castle, [built by
Queen Elizabeth of freestone] amongst which is a fayre great
chamber with other lodgings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a roome in one of the towers of the castle they
usually kept their auditt once by the yeare for the whole Dutchy
of Lancaster, having ever bin the prime seate thereof, where all
the recordes for the whole countrey are kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The constable of the castle is Sir William Mounson Lord
Castlemayne, who receaveth a revenue out of the Dutchy lands of
&pound;500. per annum, in part of payment of &pound;1000. yearely
given by the king to the Countesse of Nottingham his lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thinge is not to be passed by affirmed as a
certaine trueth by many of the inhabitants of the towne upon
their owne knowledge, which is, that the castle is haunted by a
certain spirit in the likenesse of a hare; which att the meeting
of the auditors doeth usually runne betweene their legs, and
sometymes overthrows them, and soe passes away.&nbsp; They have
pursued it downe into the castleyard, and seene it take in att a

it [and that there was noe other passage out, but by the doore,
or windowe, the roome being all close framed of stones within,
not having the least chinke or crevice] yet they could never
finde it.&nbsp; And att other tymes it hath been seene run in at

many of them] and they have watched the place, and sent for
houndes, and put in after it; but after a while they have come

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
